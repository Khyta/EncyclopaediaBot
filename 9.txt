#u/
::Essentials for Newbies::

Reddit’s shorthand for “User”. This is a prefix used when you are mentioning a specific user, for example u/llamageddon01. This gives a direct link to that user’s profile. This is also known as a “ping” or a “tag” and that user will get a notification whenever you use it in a comment in any subreddit, with the exception of some private subreddits, even if that person is a member.

#Unexpected……
::Lore and History::

A link or phrase posted when a reference is made to something unrelated in pop-culture but has relevance to the topic. There are many Subreddits devoted to documenting such references found in posts or comments where they wouldn’t normally be expected. These can be both accidental or deliberate.

Some notable examples are:

* r/unexpectedMontyPython \- because [Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition](https://youtu.be/sAn7baRbhx4)
* r/unexpectedoffice \- for the American remake of the British T.V. show “The Office”
* r/UnexpectedSCP \- Remember the mission: Secure. Contain. Protect.
* r/UnexpectedCommunity \- for sudden references to the T.V. show Community
* r/SuddenlySimpsons \- for when something is… suddenly Simpsons
* r/UnexpectedlyWholesome \- for when something ends up being unexpectedly wholesome
* r/unexpectedfactorial \- for posting when people are talking numbers, and type a number followed by an ! - making it a factorial
* r/UnexpectedThugLife \- for videos where thugs pop up out of nowhere

There are more; there are many, many more. Often when you least expect it.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/unexpected is for, well, everything that has an unexpected twist.

#Unsee Juice
::Jargon and Slang::

Unsee Juice is an expression used after seeing something disgusting or learning something disturbing online. On some Subreddits, typing Unsee Juice will summon u/EyeBleacherBot; a bot which links to an external gif of a cute animal.

Be warned: the extremely NSFL r/unseejuice subreddit is for stuff you wish you had never seen, and the polar opposite of r/eyebleach, which is what you are really looking for when you need Unsee Juice.

ALWAYS check the spelling when anyone links to the Eyebleach subreddit. If it isn’t spelled with an ‘a’, DO NOT click the link. You have been warned.

#untrustworthypoptarts
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A link or phrase posted when people question whether OP really did find those strange things in that stuff they bought or found. In other words, [we know you staged those screenshots, OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/5fm0eg/i_found_3_pop_tarts_in_my_pack_of_2_pop_tarts/) You're fooling no one. r/untrustworthypoptarts.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

#Unwritten Rules of Reddit
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

There are many *Unwritten Rules of Reddit*™, many of which are addressed in this dictionary. Others include:

What? Did you *really* expect me to write them down?

Having said that, because Reddit excels at being, well, Reddit, attempts are often made at defining [the *Unwritten Rules of Reddit*™](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lzrdcr/what_are_the_unwritten_laws_of_reddit/). Here’s the true true: “In any list of “unwritten rules” there’ll always be one missing and it’ll always be the one you break.” The entry [PSA](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_psa) is a good place to start, however.

#The “Unwritten Rule of Gilding”
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Probably Reddit’s #1 unwritten rule is: [“If someone is asking for gold, gild the comment above or below them, but under no circumstance gild the comment itself.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4jljsm/dear_people_of_reddit_what_are_the_unspoken_rules/d37lmap). You will note that the example *was* written and indeed, was gilded. There’s a lesson in that. Maybe.

#Upvote
::Essentials for Newbies::

A term equivalent to the like button on other platforms. This increases the Karma of the Redditor being upvoted. Also known as “updoot”. Each post or comment you make has one upvote by default. Some new users feel this is like a narcissistic upvoting of yourself. It isn’t; Reddit automatically upvotes every post or comment as a “thank you” for participating. You have the option to undo the upvote, but because that looks like a very quick downvote on your post/comment, many find that encourages others to downvote in a ‘Hivemind’ bandwagon effect. Ignore the upvote like everyone else does as it doesn’t contribute towards your karma.

Some subreddits have chosen to replace the default “arrow” icons with ones of their own. In case it isn’t obvious which is which, the Upvote will be on the top (Old Reddit; desktop) or on the left (Mobile App).

Sometimes an upvote comes with an amusing codicil:

* The Wishful Multiupvote - such as "I regret that I have but one upvote to give."
* The Reluctant or Angry upvote - such as “Take my upvote and leave.”

If you like something or you think it contributes to a conversation, always click that upvote arrow (or whatever icon that subreddit has replaced it with). On Reddit, that's just considered good manners. Reddit loves good manners.

#User Flair
::Essentials for Newbies::

That ‘confetti’ you might see after a username is called a User Flair, and is only available in some subs. You can make your own sometimes but most will either be from a pick list or bestowed upon you by a moderator for a reason specific to that sub. Some subreddits require you to have been [given a user flair by the mods before you can comment or post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/gumxuy/what_is_bpt_country_club_and_how_do_i_get/) to prove you’re a verified user.

[To see if flairs are available](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205242695-How-do-I-get-user-flair-) on a sub, go to its front page, click the three dots (Hamburger Menu) on the top right hand corner if you're on mobile or the community options on the right of your screen if you're on desktop. The option “select user flair” should let you know if you can make your own or give you a choice from a pre-determined selection. On mobile, tapping your username from a comment made in that sub will also bring up a “change user flair” option underneath your Trophies icons.

On r/NewToReddit, I give out user flairs according to my own super secret criteria. Maybe if you stick around long enough, you might get one…

#User-History Based Moderation
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

If a mod wants to know who the new user in their sub is, the first thing they do is look at the user’s profile. It doesn’t take long to assess from the variety of subs, types of posts and content of comments they see there whether that user is going to be a [good and thoughtful contributor](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/2jkz7c/mod_tool_sockpuppet_detector/) to their sub or not. You are judged in seconds, not minutes, and increasingly, if a user has posts or comments in a karmafarm, [they are very likely to earn a preemptive ban from other subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/pk092t/note_is_dont_go_to_karma_farms_unless_you_want_to/).

Reddit is about content and participation; karmafarms encourage quite the opposite and anyone could be forgiven for thinking that someone who’s last umpteen comments are some variation of “Upvoted!!!! Please return the favour” may not be the most valuable addition to the conversation.

To show you the attitude of many mods towards karmafarms, frequent requests in the mod subreddits go like this: “We need more bots that ban you from subreddit A if you ever post in subreddit B.” “Set up a bot to ban anyone who posts to the free-karma-begging subreddits.” In response to this demand, one was indeed developed and is being rolled out for [automatic farmed karma detection](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/ousviy/introducing_contextmod_a_moderatorconfigurable/).

As more and more subs are cracking down on people with those places in their history, it’s important that you avoid them. If you already have contributed in some, it’s worth the time taken to go through your profile history and delete the comments and posts to get them out of there. Karmafarms are a very real problem that Reddit admin are asked about time and time again, and in the absence of further directive since the Reddit CEO made his last [statement about Karma farming](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/f8y9nx/spring_forward_into_reddits_2019_transparency/fiodt6l/), mods are increasingly working on different ways of dealing with them.

#Username
::Essentials for Newbies::

Too late to tell you now, Dear Redditor, but once you have chosen and used a Reddit Username [it can’t be changed](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204579479-Can-I-change-my-username-). Ever. You can change your profile name but your username will be with you for ever. If your account is brand new, you have nothing to lose by deleting it and making a brand new one, this time being careful with your selection of username.

However, you might be able to change it if you created your account by clicking "sign in with Google/Apple". Doing that creates an account with a random username, usually consisting of [two unrelated words joined with an underscore or hyphen, followed by a random number](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/n75l53/my_icon_info/).

These automatically generated usernames can be changed within 30 days of account creation by going to your profile where a prompt should appear asking if you would like to keep or change the username. If the prompt does not show up, you may have accidentally chosen to keep the username and you would have to create a new account in order to have another username.

Having said all of that, most social media is about the individual and Reddit, quite simply, isn’t. For the most part, nobody refers to each other by name or even remembers usernames here; many are incomprehensible in any event. You might consider using it as a Throwaway Account once you’re established here for things you might not want associated with your more familiar username.

Always check a person's username if they say something stupid, as it might just be part of their persona. Joke or parody accounts aren’t as prevalent on Reddit as, perhaps, Twitter, but they do exist. There are also automated bot accounts that are triggered by posting certain words, and again, the username will give that away.

#UWU
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::


Uwu is an [emoticon depicting a cute face](https://cutekaomoji.com/characters/uwu/) which looks like (◡ ω ◡) or (ᵕ꒳ᵕ) among other forms. Also known as [happy anime face](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/uwu), uwu is often used in Japanese and Korean online culture in response to something especially cute. The u characters represent eyes, while the w represents a mouth. A closely related emoticon is owo, which can more specifically show surprise and excitement. There are many variations of uwu and owo, including and OwO, UwU, and OwU, among others. These are [not universally liked](https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/what-does-uwu-mean/) so, like all emojis, be cautious about their use on Reddit. Post examples at r/uwu.

#Visibility
::Essentials for Newbies::

What people can see about your Reddit activity starts with your Profile Page at [https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile](https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile). This shows the entirety of your visible activity on Reddit, and you can use this to make a statement about yourself if you wish, such as your personal gender pronoun (PGP) or display a personal motto. Not many Redditors will bother to look at Profile Pages before commenting though, so do bear that in mind.

Your Profile Page will show your Post, Comment and recently browsed sub history to anyone who looks at it. This means that any posts or comments you make in any subreddit will be visible, with the exception of those made in private subs where the viewer of your profile is not eligible to enter. This cannot be hidden. Some of your profile settings can be toggled on and off however, which include:

    - Content visibility:    

Posts to your profile can appear in r/all and your profile can be discovered in /users. Posting directly to your profile is optional. If you choose not to post to your profile you will not have a need for moderation tools, but those who might wish to use their profile page as a personal blog/subreddit are advised to look at the Profile Moderation Page link in Settings --> Profile.

    - Active in communities visibility:    

Show which communities you recently browsed or are active in on your profile. To toggle this setting on the mobile app, tap your profile icon in the upper left corner My Profile --> Edit --> Turn off "Show active communities" --> Save (upper right corner).

    - NSFW:    

This content is NSFW (may contain nudity, pornography, profanity or inappropriate content for those under 18).

    - Online status controls:    

If you don’t want to share your online status, you can disable the feature by tapping the Online Status button below your Snoovatar, or the ‘privacy options’ section of your preferences, uncheck ‘Let others see my online status’ then click ‘save options’.

Unfortunately, you cannot hide the list of any subreddits you moderate from your desktop or mobile browser profile, though they currently can’t be seen from the mobile app.

#Void
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Along with “House panther”, Void is a word used widely on Reddit to describe [a black cat](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackcats/comments/n9nw0t/when_your_neighbour_is_a_pro_photographer_doing_a/); a cat so black that light cannot penetrate the surface of its fur; a blackness so extreme that it is almost impossible to tell how close you are standing to it. A Void is living, purring [Vantablack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vantablack) \- one of the darkest substances known to science, absorbing up to 99.965% of visible light.

A Void is often said to be a cat so black that we can only observe it through [its gravitational effect on other objects](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoidCats/comments/n3nzf8/a_perfect_portal/) because it does not emit light and cannot be directly observed. There is no escape from within the [event horizon of a void](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/n2rv0s/emerging_from_the_cat_dimension/).

It is also said that if you gaze for long into the void, the void gazes also into you and will want tuna when it wakes up. Find out if that’s true at r/blackcats, r/blackpussy or r/VoidCats. Then feast your eyes on the [classiest cat you will ever see](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/ql904p/the_classiest_cat_costume_you_will_see_all_year/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

#Vote Arrows hidden or greyed-out on Posts
::Essentials for Newbies::

[Reddit sometimes hides the vote buttons/vote count on a new or fairly new Post](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204579919-Why-do-some-comments-show-score-hidden-instead-of-the-total-number-of-votes-). This doesn’t happen on all subreddits, but it's hidden on some subs so users won't be biased based on the amount of votes the post already has and will instead upvote/downvote it purely based on how they feel themselves.  [The goal of this is to hopefully curtail and minimize the effects of bandwagon voting, both positive and negative](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204511579-Why-does-the-post-score-sometimes-not-appear-).

This option is available for moderators to implement as a subreddit-wide feature to obscure the vote counts on comments for a predetermined amount of time after their submission. The default time is set for 2 hours, but can go anywhere from 1 minute to 24 hours. Another way of doing this is for a mod to enable 'contest mode' which randomises the sorting and obscures Child Comments. Hiding the vote score will not affect the sorting and Child Comments will continue to be displayed as usual. Other reasons for vote buttons being greyed out are because:

* The post is over 6 months old and is archived (a yellow box icon will be shown on the top RH).
* The post is locked by the mods (a yellow padlock icon will be shown on the top RH).
* The post has been removed by the mods but is still in your post/comment history.
* The post has blown up and has reached an upvote/downvote limit.

TL;DR: It’s all part of the Reddit ethos to level the playing field on all new submissions and to keep things moving, fresh and relevant.

#Vote Fuzzing
::General Guides::

There isn’t a 1:1 relationship between votes and karma. It might appear that way especially at the early stage of your Karma count and the early stage of your post or comment, but that isn’t the case. Reddit uses a technique called Vote Fuzzing for several clever (and a few mundane) reasons.

Vote Fuzzing is an automatic process built in by Reddit that slightly changes the vote counts on posts and comments each time you refresh the page. It prevents spam because people trying to use upvote/downvote bots will have no idea if the bot is working or not.

Want to see this work? Try this yourself: I upvoted a random post, and it showed three upvotes. Then I refreshed the page and it showed four upvotes. Then I refreshed again, and it showed two upvotes. That's Vote Fuzzing in action. It's explained in the [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) pretty well too: *Some up/downvotes are by Reddit to fuzz the votes* [*in order to confuse spammers and cheaters*](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/eaqnf/pardon_me_but_5000_downvotes_wtf_is_worldnews_for/)*.*

#Vote Manipulation
::Features of Reddit::

This is strictly [against the Reddit rules](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043066412) and is one of the things that could earn you a Permaban. So what do we mean by Vote Manipulation?  [An experiment in vote manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/pmqk28/i_bought_some_upvotes_out_of_sheer_curiosity_and/)is interesting if a little elaborate. It can actually be as simple as:

* Asking people to vote up or down on certain posts or comments.
* Creating or using an Alt to upvote or award your own posts.
* Forming or joining a group or sub that votes together on a specific post or comment.
* Forming or joining a group or sub that votes together on a specific user's posts or comments.
* Using a bot or other automated process that crawls through Reddit to up or downvote particular posts or comments.

The Reddit Admins can see IP addresses, so if they see that several users all have the same IP address and are all busy upvoting each other, they may well suspect foul play. Don’t do it. It isn’t worth it.

#Vowels
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Vowels are serious business on Reddit. From discussing language theory on r/phonetics or r/linguistics to Vowel Modification on r/singing, through to language invention on r/conlangs to the completely absurd on r/AVoid5; a community that can post anything as long that fifth symbol of our ABC's is totally missing.

Some subs go even further.  r/animalswithoutnecks does not allow the use of vowels at all. Why? Because vowels are the ‘necks’ of words and as it is a ‘without necks’ sub, they don't want you to use them. So, back to language theory then.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

If you prefer consonants, you might find a home at r/ggggg which is devoted to just the one. There will be others; there will always be others.

#“When is the best time to Post for maximum attention?”
::Essentials for Newbies::

Theres a lot of speculation and analysis out there about this. The answers range from a specific 10:00am - 3:00pm EST (2:00pm - 7:00am GMT) through to “when the majority of Americans are awake”. Reddit itself doesn't boost posts depending on the time they are made but obviously a big world event posted on r/news will need to be posted immediately it happens but that type of post will generate its own traction.

There is a school of thought that with judicious timing you can [definitely help determine how well your post does](https://maxcandocia.com/article/2017/Jul/29/what-time-to-post-to-reddit/) and that the time you post to Reddit [actually matters a great deal](https://foundationinc.co/lab/reddit-statistics/). If you are really serious about planning the timing of your posts, tools like [Later for Reddit](https://dashboard.laterforreddit.com/analysis/)and [Delay for Reddit](https://www.delayforreddit.com/analysis) may be useful. Let me know the results!

I personally believe that timing isn't as big of a factor as, say, quality or originality. If a post is engaging or interesting to people, it will catch on. Posting quality content will always be more important than posting at any particular time. But I’ve never had a post make it to r/popular, so what do I know…

#Wholesome
::Jargon and Slang::

An old-fashioned word beloved by Reddit meaning innocent, clean, moral, decent. Think squeaky-clean child-friendly, possibly even enlightening entertainment and you’re there. On Reddit over the years, Wholesome, like many other words, has changed its meaning. It was originally used ironically to mean weak or anodyne in much the same way that the use of the word “lame” does not describe a walking impediment but instead means something is uninspiring, dull, or even “cringe”; another word that has acquired additional meaning.

Reddit has two Awards called Wholesome; a low-cost one sometimes given free for "When you come across a feel-good thing" and an Appreciation Award called Wholesome (Pro). Both icons are based on the [Seal of Approval or Satisfied Seal meme picture](https://external-preview.redd.it/TqVapkbtqVO-yPW7cjvXkqKo43Zp2tnI9MwcG2aUaQQ.jpg?auto=webp&s=6631668a40a24abf2fa7a2eebb7d0a841fc0361b).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

We have many “feel-good” subreddits, and a good starter Custom Feed is [the Wholesome Network](https://www.reddit.com/user/awkwardtheturtle/m/wholesome/).

#Wiki
::Essentials for Newbies::

Something you might see on a subreddit is a “Wiki” tab. A subreddit Wiki is basically the F.A.Q’s of a sub. The entries are often based on the work of one or two long-time moderators, then expanded and refined over time to become a repository of the subreddit’s knowledge and experience.

A wiki can take the form of full-length articles, collections of useful statements, or collections of external links. Our Wiki is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/wiki/index) and is the result of the ongoing communal effort of our awesome mod team who review it often to keep it current, useful and easy to use.

Unfortunately, the Reddit mobile app isn’t yet compatible with the format of sub wikis and doesn’t recognise much of the formatting, any of the internal hotlinks or any hyperlink from a post or comment to it. Viewing a sub wiki in its full glory on mobile is currently only possible by opening a browser and going directly to the website.

#Witty Comebacks
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Everyone wants to feel victorious as they walk away from an argument, and nothing’s better than coming up with *that* sick burn at the precise moment. Reddit has a few tried-and-tested ways of doing this which you will find scattered around this lexicon, usually in “quotation marks”. There are also many websites or even Pinterests dedicated to helping you in your quest, of which [100 Good Comebacks](https://parade.com/1105374/marynliles/good-comebacks/) is one of the better ones. There are also a few subreddits that might inspire you:

* r/clevercomebacks is a place for great retorts. If someone just got shown up, this is the place to post it.
* r/MurderedByWords is a place for well-constructed put-downs, comebacks, and counter-arguments.
* r/rareinsults is a place for sublime, non-threatening, non-hateful rare insults.
* r/whatstheword for when there’s a word in your mind that you just cannot remember.
* r/YouGotTold for when some people deserve to get told and to honour those brave souls who take it upon themselves to do the telling.
* r/BrandNewSentence for sentences never before written, found in the wild.

Of course, you could also just say [“no u”](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=no%20u) or if you’re feeling especially loquacious, [“eat pant”](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bootleg-bart). Not forgetting, of course,[“kthxbye"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kthxbye); the very pinnacle of the development of the English language, shortening "All is correct. Thank you, and may God be with you." into seven lowercase letters.

And because [every day’s a school day](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=every%20day%27s%20a%20school%20day), *L'esprit de l'escalier* or [l'esprit d'escalier: “mind of the staircase”](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/l%27esprit_de_l%27escalier) is a French term used in English for the predicament of thinking of the perfect reply too late. Hence, r/staircasewit was for those moments of wit that left you wishing you had thought of them earlier.  r/showercomebacks needs reviving too…

#woooosh
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

r/woooosh is a subreddit link posted as a reply to when the OP or someone in the comments has missed the joke. You reply r/woooosh when someone doesn't get a joke, and reply r/itswooooshwith4os when someone misspells r/woooosh. Because [someone always misspells it](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8zgics/which_whoosh_is_the_correct_whoosh_i_mean_there/) and ends up at r/whooosh.

Woosh in all its varieties is an onomatopoeic word meant to represent the sound of rushing air infilling the vacuum when a joke rushes above someone’s head faster than the speed of sound.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

There’s also r/woosh for the same thing, and r/WOSH which certainly isn’t.

#“You are doing that too much”
::Essentials for Newbies::

Seen by many a new Redditor, this pop-up message isn’t personal; it’s just there until you build up enough Karma to prove to Reddit that you’re a genuine, real-life, honest-to-goodness Redditor. Occasionally it pops up if you keep pressing “send” on your post or comment and nothing happens, usually when the internet connection is lagging or Reddit is having server issues. This helps prevent your post or comment being duplicated several times once the issue is resolved.

#"You are technically correct, the best type of correct"
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A phrase posted when the Pedants of Reddit rise up. Originating in [Futurama S02E14](https://youtu.be/hou0lU8WMgo), here’s a [typical Reddit example](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/36m7dh/just_a_turtle_eating_pancakes/crfacnb/?context=3).

#YSK

YSK that I must be completely [bonkers](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/10/1c/a2/101ca24a630f6b78edcc5082724fc525--llama-llama-best-photo.jpg).
