#/s
::General Guides::

Used at the end of a comment to denote when sarcasm is being attempted. Obviously. /s

As you might have discovered by now, we like to mock things at Reddit. The words “sardonic” and “sarcastic” both stand for mocking gestures, but you should know the difference between the two.  [Useless Etymology](https://uselessetymology.com/2019/05/27/the-suuper-interesting-etymologies-of-the-words-sarcastic-and-sardonic/) defines the difference as being:

* Sarcastic: “marked by or given to using irony in order to mock or convey contempt.”
* Sardonic: “characterized by bitter or scornful derision; mocking; cynical; sneering: a sardonic grin.”

There [are many](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4grv7a/eli5_sarcastic_vs_cynical_vs_sardonic/) different attempts [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2ibdmd/eli5_the_difference_between_facetious_satiric/) to define [the difference](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2wrmy5/eli5_whats_the_difference_between_sarcasm_and/) but the general consensus is that if you’re British, it’s [in your heritage](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/p60mk7/whats_the_difference_between_american_sarcasm_and/) and is the fundamental difference between [British and American humour](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bb5oof/why_is_american_humour_so_different_to_british/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Of course we have r/sarcasm for your finest examples. And r/Irony. We also have r/words to discuss the meaning of them. How meta. /s

#Sadfishing
::Jargon and Slang::

A term used when social influencers play up emotional troubles to boost ‘likes’, often deliberately holding certain details back in order to “hook” their followers in, coined by [journalist Rebecca Reid in 2019](https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/21/sadfishing-social-media-trend-making-misery-profitabl-8367931/) by stating that “Sadfishers maximise the drama of their situation to create engagement on social media in the emotional equivalent of clickbait”.

* **Am I a sadfisher?**

Doubtful. There’s nothing wrong with posting about our problems on social media. Reddit especially can be an extremely supportive place and very conducive to openness. Sadfishing is more about overdramatised “celebrity gossip” to grab attention from the maximum number of random people than airing genuine concern or soliciting advice from friends or mentors in an appropriate forum. There is a big difference between sharing genuine distress with a select group of people when needing help, and sharing a glossy, highly filtered version of pretend sadness with the whole world for marketing purposes.

[In the words of Rebecca Reid:](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/in-the-news/sadfishing/) “I made \[the word\] up after (a celeb) ran a teaser campaign ahead of her collaboration \[with a skincare company\]. She sat in a [white T-shirt, face to camera](https://i.redd.it/7qr1j1fawqb91.jpg), saying that she was finally ready to share her secret. The internet went bonkers. Was she coming out? Was she going to add her voice to the #MeToo movement? Nope. She eventually told us that she used to have spots. Having bad skin can be traumatic, I get that. But she didn't share an unfiltered picture of her acne to her Instagram to normalise having skin problems. She shared a beautifully shot teaser video where her skin glowed with perfection. That's sadfishing.”

* **When sharing goes wrong**

Being able to read other people’s posts or stories about their own wellbeing can help you feel less alone. Social media can help you build connections, strengthen relationships, allow you to speak freely, seek help and give you a sense of community in order to make sense of your own issues.

The danger with regularly sharing your sadness and issues online is that sharing *any* situation online will occasionally cause you to receive negative backlash or wild accusations from people who don't fully understand the situation. More subtly, there is potential for addiction to the attention you'll get from random strangers by your mind subconsciously learning that being sad equates to being validated. Add this to the fact that the anonymity of sympathy from the internet can often feel better than the realism you may get from family or friends, and those quick dopamine hits can become very tempting to chase. Try to keep a balance between sharing your down times with the good ones - no matter how mundane.

* **When sharing goes very wrong**

There’s been a huge amount of visibility about the difficulties of living with disability or chronic illness in recent years due to the increase and accessibility of social media platforms. This generally positive newfound outlet for such people has, unfortunately, also given rise to a disturbing “bandwagon effect”.

“Factitious disorder imposed on self” is the term for a mental condition more commonly known as [Munchausen's Syndrome](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/munchausens-syndrome/symptoms/) which may include pretending to be ill or self-harming to aggravate or induce illness. This can also be aimed towards others, which is known as “Factitious disorder imposed on another” or [Munchausen by Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factitious_disorder_imposed_on_another). A more recent variation is increasingly being known as [“Munchausen by Internet”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510683/), where people fake or exaggerate illness for profit on social media, especially on platforms where the number of “likes”, “subscribers” or “followers” can be monetised.

The problem here is that such behaviour can have a significant negative impact on support groups and online communities, and risks labelling genuine sufferers of chronic ill health as 'fakers', ‘malingerers’ or 'hypochondriacs'. Indeed, the more you see some of the more [absurd stories](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/29/jules-gibson-munchausen-by-internet-sickness-bloggers-fake-it-whole-pantry) the easier it is to become more cynical when you read about someone with an illness or condition that is both uncommon and ‘invisible’. The danger then is someone with an authentic but unique experience could reach out for help but ends up making matters worse by being ridiculed.

* **If it can’t be seen, is it real?**

[Invisible Disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_disability), or hidden disability, is an umbrella term that captures a [whole spectrum of impairments or challenges](https://www.disabled-world.com/disability/types/invisible/) that are primarily neurological in nature and not immediately apparent, of which the most obvious example is deafness.

Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD is another. For some critics, the label is merely an excuse for frustrated parents to dismiss a child's annoying behaviours. While it is possible there may be a [grain of truth in that at times](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/gp74k6/adhd_is_not_an_excuse_for_your_kid_being_fucking/), there definitely is a difference between using ADHD as an [excuse or as an explanation](https://danarayburn.com/using-adhd-as-an-excuse/).

When reading advice subs, take every claim you read seriously at first. It’s fine to take time to “read between the lines” but try not to be instantly dismissive. Acting in good faith and reading with a balance of healthy scepticism and sincerity is by far the best approach. Even if the post you respond to does turn out to be fake, don’t be ashamed about being deceived and don’t delete the sincere thoughts you might have shared. You may never know, but someone in the future in a real and similar situation might one day read your comment and find you have given them the help they genuinely needed.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/illnessfakers track online illness fakers and scammers exploiting vulnerable patients for money, highlighting influencers who make antiscientific claims, and generally discussing those who they believe exaggerate or fake their illnesses online, while r/IllnessFakersFakers study the IllnessFakers subreddit itself.

r/ChronicIllness is a place for people to discuss everyday life with chronic illness, ask questions or just meme around, and r/TrueChronicIllness is a chronic illness support/discussion community.

Use the Search bar to find subreddits for information or support on many specific illnesses or conditions. As always, do be careful to read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) before contributing to any subreddit that is new to you.

#Sagan Standard
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

The Sagan Standard is a saying commonly known as an “Eponymous Law”, but more accurately as a [Philosophical Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor) that reads [”Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagan_standard) which is often shortened to the mnemonic ECREE. It falls under the philosophical concept of [Burden of Proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy)).

Applied broadly, this particular principle suggests that if someone claims that their name is Bob, that's not an extraordinary claim requiring evidence, but if someone claims that they saw a UFO, that is an extraordinary claim which must be backed up by extraordinary evidence to prove it.

* **A non-standard standard**

While a philosophical razor can be a useful mental shortcut that allows you to make decisions and solve problems quickly and easily, it is not an unbreakable law or rule, and Sagan’s Standard is no exception because Sagan never defined the term “extraordinary.” Meeting a tour guide on a street in London claiming their name is Bob might not require evidence, but receiving a phone call from someone with a foreign accent claiming their name is Bob and speaking from your internet provider because you need to hand over your account details to them immediately probably should.

Ambiguity in what constitutes “extraordinary” has led to misuse of the aphorism. Perhaps even negating Sagan’s original intention, ECREE is commonly invoked to discredit research dealing with scientific anomalies, and has even been rhetorically employed in attempts to raise doubts concerning mainstream scientific hypotheses that have substantive empirical support.

* **The Sagan Standard on Reddit**

Reddit, as you would expect, takes the Sagan Standard [Very Seriously Indeed™](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/m2ktrl/do_extraordinary_claims_require_extraordinary/) especially at r/askphilosophy where [it’s often debated](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/4wiio2/do_extraordinary_claims_require_extraordinary/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/carlsagan is the home for everything Carl Sagan related.

#”Sauce?”
::Jargon and Slang::

A word posted to request source material for a quote, statistic, news item, image, single comic panel or other such random items carrying no explanation of where they came from. Shorter to type than \[Citation needed\]. Substantiate those claims, people! You don’t want to be called out and end up at r/quityourbullshit. Having said that, being the first to comment with a reliable source when one isn’t provided can [pay karma dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyFuckingVideos/comments/x2a2ug/life_finds_a_way/imi6bjt/) if you find yourself in the right post at the right time…

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Not everything on Reddit needs proof of origin. We have a selection of subreddits that glory in their lack of context, such as:

* r/outofcontextcomics \- The place to post comic book panels that are strange or funny if taken out of context.
* r/nocontext \- Classic lines from other Reddit posts.
* r/nocontextpics \- Where there are no sob stories - or stories of any kind.
* r/outofcontextmemes \- A subreddit for inside joke memes that are hilarious, but only in the given context.
* r/OOCQ \- A subreddit for quotes taken out of context, causing them to sound bizarre.
* r/OutOfContextQuotes \- currently banned for being unmoderated, this could be ripe for adoption…
* r/outofcontextmanga \- No context, out of context, funny, shocking, whatever (NSFW).
* r/ProgrammingNoContext \- A place to post programming documentation, code snippets, google searches etc that appear weird out of context.
* r/outofcontextwikihow \- A subreddit for finding pictures or even titles from wikiHow that need context.
* r/WithoutContext: Funny things happen when you take things out of context…

However, even those posting in r/outofcontextcomics get asked for a source [occasionally](https://www.reddit.com/r/outofcontextcomics/comments/mhu7mf/superman_and_batman_share_a_bed/gt18ji3/) so…

#Save
::General Guides::

You might well find a post so awesome you want to keep it forever in your own personal catalogue. Reddit has a facility [called Saved posts](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205243605-How-do-I-save-a-post-and-where-does-it-get-saved-) under which you can bookmark posts for easy future reference. I am given to believe that this is limited to 1,000 posts and saving any more than that will push the bottom ones out of the list. Should a post you saved be subsequently deleted by its author or the subreddit, it will also disappear from your Saved list.

*Some of the links below are to third-party sites not affiliated with Reddit, so may I caution you to do your research first before using them. None of these are endorsed by myself or this subreddit but are provided for your information.*

* **Saving Posts**

To save a post, click the Save link “bookmark” icon underneath the post (desktop), or use the Save option under the three-dot drop-down hamburger menu on the top right-hand corner (mobile).

To view your saved posts, go to your profile page and choose the Saved option from the top line menu [(desktop)](https://i.redd.it/j3i1aksfawr81.jpg) or tap on your avatar to open your profile menu and tap Saved [(mobile)](https://i.redd.it/7frqb7qm9wr81.png). Reddit Premium members on desktop get extra sorting options for their saved posts. I’m a Premium member but on mobile so don’t actually know what they are or if they work.

* **Bypassing the 1,000 Post Limit**

I have personally found the Saved system on iOS mobile to be buggy; posts I know I saved sometimes don’t show up on my list even though the post wasn’t deleted. So, here’s me being controversial yet again. If I find a post I absolutely need to save for future reference (usually cats or stuff for these guides but YMMV), I actually copy the URL to a Notes page so it’s easy to copy and paste it into a browser. The title of the post is saved in the link but occasionally I’ll make a note of one or two words to remind me what it was and why I saved it! Ah, how analogue can still save the day, as this also gets round the 1,000 post limit too.

The URL of a post can be gotten from the mobile app from pressing [the Share arrow](https://i.redd.it/ei5rj8anfib91.png) directly beneath the post or the Share option from the three-dot “hamburger” [Post Overflow menu](https://i.redd.it/6b238xsrfib91.png) on the top right-hand corner.

This is something I’ve not tried but have been told works, so *caveat emptor*. Did you know you can recover your entire user history (past 1,000 items) with [Reddit data request](https://www.reddit.com/settings/data-request)? You can then externally store your Reddit items (saved, created, upvoted, downvoted, hidden) in your own database and view, search or filter them with [Eternity for Reddit](https://eternity.portals.sh/).

* **Saving Videos**

I don’t tend to download videos, so I haven’t tested any of these to see if they work successfully or not, but over the years, Reddit has had several service bots to help you download videos or gifs. Some subreddits even have an Automod message with the video ready to download, like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeopleFuckingDying/comments/vyt5t9/infamous_cat_burglar_breaks_into_family_home_robs/) from the figuratively named r/PeopleFuckingDying.

**Service Bots**

* u/savevideo \- a video downloader bot from RedditSave that helps you save videos from Reddit in three simple steps: Step 1: Mention u/savevideo in a reddit post with video or gif.  
Step 2: You'll get a response in a few seconds. Click on the reponse link.  
Step 3: Click the Download HD Video button to download and save the video to your local device storage.
* u/vredditshare \- reply this username to a post containing a Reddit hosted video or a comment with a link to a post containing a Reddit hosted video, and it will then send you a link to the mirrored upload.
* u/savevideobot \- reply this username to a post containing a Reddit hosted video or a comment with a link to a post containing a Reddit hosted video, and it will then send you a link to the mirrored upload.

**Other ways include:**

* [https://redditsave.com](https://redditsave.com/) \- a powerful online Reddit video downloader for videos and gifs embedded from v.redd.it, imgur, gfycat, streamable, giphy etc with audio for free.
* [https://savemp4.red](https://savemp4.red/) \- to download Reddit videos with sound.
* [https://redditvideodl.com](https://redditvideodl.com/) \- just paste the Reddit URL you want to download in the URL box and click the Download button.
* [https://saveredd.it](https://saveredd.it/) \- download videos and audio with easy illustrated tutorial.
* [https://reddloader.com](https://reddloader.com/) \- a powerful web-based tool that allows users to trim and download videos from Reddit with sound and without any quality issues.

#Scams
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Soliciting of any kind on Reddit is against the rules, but it absolutely [still happens in private](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/pluwsn/isnt_soliciting_on_reddit_against_the_rules/) and very much in public in posts displaying [t-shirts](https://www.reddit.com/r/FruitsBasket/comments/dcnuyv/psa_there_is_a_tshirt_scam_ring_active_on_reddit/), posters, mugs, prints, stickers - basically anything saying “look at my cool stuff” or similar.  [Why you should not buy T-shirts/hoodies/mugs linked in comments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/httyd/comments/cl3el6/) Don’t be tempted by anything you see because you run the very [real risk of being scammed](https://old.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/3jss04/meta_spammers_how_they_work_and_how_to_spot_them/) along with getting yourself permabanned from the sub along with the OP and all the other replies. If you really REALLY want that thingy, you should try to find a reputable dealer elsewhere. Or Amazon.

Some interesting reads on Reddit about scams are [this AMA with an Internet scammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9x7lu/iama_internet_scammer_ama/) and when someone asked Reddit if anyone had [ever been scammed](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/canjua/have_you_ever_got_scammed_what_happened/?sort=top) it prompted over 8,000 comments.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/Scams is the place to let people know about any online, offline, email, SMS or postal scams you might encounter; r/scammers indexes scam details to help people not get scammed and r/scambait users waste scammers’ time and resources to keep them away from real victims.

#Sealioning
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

The term Sealioning was coined in 2014 by David Malki in his webcomic [Wondermark #1062; The Terrible Sea Lion](http://wondermark.com/1k62/) to describe a type of trolling in which someone disingenuously pretends to be clueless about an issue in order to derail the conversation or detract from the issue in hand. Which as you know is one of Reddit’s [favourite diversionary tactics](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2zlyad/what_is_sealioning/) during any debate or argument.

In any conversation, all the power goes to the person asking questions because there’s no burden of proof required on a question, and anyone who simply ignores a question will look like they’re either evading the issue, don’t know the issue in sufficient depth to be able to answer, or just being annoying.

A sea lion in this context isn’t really asking questions to know the answer, as they’re not interested in critical thinking or debate, and even if you do provide information that would normally be sufficient, the sea lion will still ask for more, and keep on doing so beyond any reasonable level. Why? Because they aren’t doing this in good faith to clarify points or gain information; it’s purely and simply to deflect your focus in the argument so you’re now serving them, instead of making your own point on your own terms.

As it is far quicker and easier to ask almost any question than it would be to answer it, a sea lion relies heavily on the [bullshit asymmetry principle](https://sketchplanations.com/the-bs-asymmetry-principle) to waste your mental energies. Also known as [Brandolini’s Law](https://twitter.com/ziobrando/status/289635060758507521), this eponymous law is the simple observation that it’s far easier to produce and spread bullshit, misinformation and nonsense than it is to refute it.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/Sealioning never really got off the ground. But as the word “sea lion” has different associations, I would be remiss in not mentioning r/seals: Reddit’s home for anything and everything related to seals, sea lions and walruses, and keep up with [this link](https://www.reddit.com/t/sea_lion/) for all the up-to-date best posts and communities about sea lions on Reddit.

Finally, [here’s an illustrated guide to the difference between seals and sea lions](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/qp2hs5/seals_vs_sea_lions/) for your general edification.

#Searching
::General Guides::

There’s a history of millions of posts for you to search on Reddit, and finding exactly what you’re looking for requires you to know a few tricks. Reddit’s native search facility is somewhat lacking and is something that’s been [worked on](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/the-search-for-better-search-at-reddit) many times over the years. For instance, it wasn’t until April 2022 that the search feature was updated to index comments.

As Reddit search continues to undergo [upgrades](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/pjw2yl/whats_up_with_reddit_search_episode_iii_the_front/), the official subreddit r/reddit is the place to keep up to date with this and all other major changes to Reddit. The most [recent official guide](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search)should therefore be your first port of call, and this recent [Lifehacker article](https://lifehacker.com/reddit-has-hidden-search-tools-1849089864) goes into more detail on the optimising filters available.

As always, these features are mostly only available on the desktop or browser versions of Reddit, and not the mobile app.

* **Reddit’s Search Bar**

We’ve already established that Reddit’s search [isn’t currently the best](https://www.reddit.com/r/topofreddit/comments/65t796/and_now_a_look_at_the_machine_that_powers_reddits/), but it’s still the easiest and quickest way to find what you’re looking for. You can also use the following modifier tags as part of your search query:

* **subreddit:subreddit** \- *find submissions in "subreddit"*
* **author:username** \- *find submissions by "username"*
* **site:example.com** \- *find submissions from "example.com"*
* **url:text** \- *search for "text" in url*
* **self:yes (or self:no)** \- *include (or exclude) self posts*
* **nsfw:yes (or nsfw:no)** \- *include (or exclude) results marked as NSFW*

You might like this [illustrated guide](https://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/advanced-search-on-reddit-like-a-pro/) to using these. Another guide can be [found here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/right-way-search-reddit/).

* **Google is your friend (other search engines are available)**

You can use Google to help you find posts on Reddit. For instance, to find your own contributions, type the following in to the Google search bar: site:reddit.com yourusername Note that you type your username without the u/. You can substitute any keyword to find relevant Reddit content this way, for example: site:reddit.com llama

#\[Serious\]
::General Guides::

Used in a post title asking for serious responses only. Originally a [sub specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1hi7xx/what_do_you_think_of_raskreddits_serious_tag/) label from r/askreddit now with wider Reddit usage.  [Using this tag](https://i.redd.it/vgl31lsgfxc91.png) will alert the mods to remove funny or joke responses to your post. Some subs have this as a Post Flair to achieve the same effect.

Do not be tempted to make a humorous reply in a post with this flair or request, no matter how tempting or hilarious it would be, as it will be a flagrant breach of the subreddit rules and a legitimate reason for a ban.

#Shadowban
::General Guides::

A shadowban is a type of sitewide account ban on Reddit that can only be given at the Admin level or by the automatic spam filter. In mid 2021, the tightening of these filters led to an inordinate number of [new users being instantly shadowbanned](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/ok6906/a_note_on_shadowbans/) through no fault of their own, and this is still happening to a certain extent throughout 2022.

A shadowban is different from any other type of ban. Many people who think they might be shadowbanned actually aren’t, and [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowBan/comments/mbr7zm/think_i_might_be_shadowbanned/grzzn5e/) gives some useful information on this. An easy way to know the difference is if Reddit as a whole or the mods of a subreddit ban you, you’ll get some kind of a notification as to the type or length and location of the ban, but a shadowbanned user will not get any notifications whatsoever.

* **Who gives what kind of ban?**

Moderators can ban users temporarily or permanently from the individual subreddits they control, but do not have the power that Admins do to apply sitewide shadowbans or suspensions. Just to remind you:

**Admins** are salaried Reddit employees that maintain Reddit as a whole. They have sitewide powers to adjust algorithms, suspend or shadowban accounts, and are essentially all-powerful.

**Moderators** are unpaid volunteers that maintain individual subreddits. They can only create Automoderator filters or give out temporary or permanent bans within a community they moderate.

* **So what happens with a Shadowban?**

A shadowbanned user’s posts and comments will continue to show up for them, but other people won’t see them except for the mods of the subreddit they post in, who will only see a ‘greyed out’ post or comment marked with a red dustbin icon.

As I said above, unlike a normal ban, an account that is shadowbanned is not notified that it has been banned. They can continue to browse Reddit, make posts and comments, and use Reddit like nothing is wrong. But what is really happening is that their profile or history cannot be viewed by any other users, including moderators, and their posts and comments are automatically removed from view by Reddit as soon as they are made. This makes the user almost invisible to anyone else, but they are completely unaware that this is the case. This is the point of shadowbans: a bot account won’t notice that their posts or comments aren’t being interacted with, and even if they do check their profiles, they will see their posts or comments as normal.

* **How did this happen?**

Being shadowbanned can happen for many reasons, and [here are some very useful tips on avoiding one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowBan/comments/8a2gpk/an_unofficial_guide_on_how_to_avoid_being/).

Keep in mind that shadowbanning is mostly an automated action. Reddit has set up algorithms and filters to try to [catch spammers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/nmhmj0/q1_safety_security_report_may_27_2021/), bots and link-farmers sharing links to malicious / dangerous sites as swiftly as possible, so it's usually not an actual person assessing your account and banning it. This means that there can be a lot of [false positives](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/oe09aa/so_many_genuine_users_shadowbanned/), where genuine users who are real people (not bots) with [good intentions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/ojhl91/shadow_bans_of_normallooking_accounts_have/) end up shadowbanned simply because their behaviour has inadvertently triggered this automatic action. It’s a problem which [isn’t going away](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/o6l2z5/f_spammers/) soon, either.

As moderators, we cannot see why a user has been shadowbanned and we cannot view profiles of shadowbanned users, so we aren't able to look through a user's history to see why they may have received the ban. We can only see the posts and comments you make in our subreddit, and can reply to them or approve them if we choose to, but we get no other information.

Intrepid r/NewToReddit and widely experienced moderator u/Casually-Average gave an excellent summary about shadowbans [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/umq5qr/what_is_a_shadow_ban_and_why_is_it_haunting_me/) which is very informative.

* **How do I fix this?**

A user will not get a notification if they get shadowbanned but if you suspect this has happened to you, check your status by posting at r/ShadowBan or r/ShadowBanned which have bots that will confirm if you are shadowbanned or not. Just simply make a post such as "Am I banned?" and the bots will respond momentarily.

If the answer is yes, lodge an appeal directly to Admin at [https://www.reddit.com/appeals](https://www.reddit.com/appeals). Your appeal message doesn't have to be elaborate, just explain that you don't know why you're banned or what happened. Admins understand that new users get flagged a lot so they should handle your appeal without question if they know you're a genuine user.

Another useful tool is [Comment Removal Checker](https://www.reddit.com/r/CommentRemovalChecker/comments/9u0zes/how_to_use_what_is_this/) but read the rules before commenting. r/CommentRemovalChecker.

#Shill
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A ‘shill’ is an accomplice in the crowd of a con game to make the fakery seem real. In Reddit terms, a Shill is a Redditor (probably a bot account) who is promoting dodgy merchandise disguised as a Post. They often [work in threes](https://i.redd.it/e7t2ni7r6gd91.jpg): one posting the product, another asking for a link and yet another offering the link or thanking the OP profusely for providing the link. All three accounts will be the same age and have very low karma because they are usually just one user engaging in sock puppetry.

You’ll note from the screenshot that the only truthful person in that particular exchange was the only one downvoted. Sometimes they’ll roll out [several sock puppets](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedievalCats/comments/w6jnr5/i_believe_i_have_acquired_the_greatest_poster_of/) in one thread if they believe it’s being successful.

Be very wary of [random posts in any sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/kx83v3/what_is_up_with_this_tshirt/) from unfamiliar or low-karma Redditors [showing off items](https://www.reddit.com/r/sharks/comments/q2m5ve/halloween_candy_corn_shark/) such as posters, stickers, T-Shirts or mugs, where the caption says generic things like [“Got this for a friend”](https://www.reddit.com/r/familyguy/comments/pzrhbw/wow_this_hoodies_is_going_to_be_perfect_for_my/) or even [“I’m so pleased with how it came out”](https://i.redd.it/lmwef426nad91.jpg). They are waiting for you to reply, and if you do, hey presto - you’ve fallen for their scam and run the risk of getting permabanned from the sub as their accomplice.

If you suspect a post to be a Shill, do not engage with it; just downvote it, comment the subreddit link r/TheseFuckingAccounts then use the [Report option](https://i.redd.it/k732ju47qhw81.jpg) as Spam --> Link Farming or report the accounts to the admins at [https://www.reddit.com/report](https://www.reddit.com/report) and move on.

You should know that if you report a post for any reason, that post will now automatically be hidden and appear in your Hidden folder, which you can see here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/me/hidden/](https://www.reddit.com/user/me/hidden/). You can Unhide it if you wish using its “hamburger” post overflow menu.

#Shipping
::Jargon and Slang::

No, this doesn’t relate to your dispatching that unwanted item you finally sold to that lucky eBay punter. In Internet terms, [“shipping”](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2pxsm3/what_the_hell_is_shipping/) is derived from the word “relationship” and is basically when someone wants to imagine two people - whether they be a fictional character or real-life person - to be together romantically.

Sometimes TV shows, books or other stories do not (or could not) develop a relationship between characters that many fans felt would be perfect for each other. People will then write fanfictions about their favorite ship, called their OTP or “One True Pairing” where the opportunity arose for them to live happily ever after, bringing closure to [their own fantasies](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/fo6n1x/shipping_is_a_joke_and_shouldnt_be_taken_seriously/).

This pairing is usually given a [“pairing” or “ship” name](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Pairing_Name) often derived from the names of the characters involved joined up with either a / symbol or the letter x, or by blending the two names together to create a new portmanteau name.

Fantasy relationship pairing is a very [divisive outlet](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ldhwmi/shippers_are_the_worst_part_of_any_fandom/), especially when real-life people [are shipped](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pueel5/shipping_is_creepy/).

* **“Please, Captain, not in front of the Klingons”**

Such imaginary pairings date from long before the Internet, with [“Slash Fic”](https://www.inverse.com/article/16203-on-star-trek-sherlock-holmes-and-the-origins-of-slash-fiction) appearing in late 1960/1970s fanzines focussing on romantic or sexual relationships between fictional characters of the same sex. The earliest of these concerned *Star Trek: The Original Series* where romantic stories about Kirk/Spock were circulated, with the name “slash fic” coming from the use of the / symbol to denote a sexual relationship between the characters (friendship or platonic fiction would use &, e.g. Kirk&Spock). An excellent study of homoeroticism in *Star Trek: The Next Generation* from 1998 [is fascinating reading](https://www.colorado.edu/gendersarchive1998-2013/1998/01/25/minding-ones-ps-and-qs-homoeroticism-star-trek-next-generation) and the footnotes (17) remind us that Kirk/Spock slash fic was officially referenced in *Star Trek V: The Final Frontier*.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Discuss the merits (or otherwise) of shipping and ships at r/CharacterRant, r/FanFiction or r/FavoriteCharacter.  r/HPSlashFic is for fanfic recommendations and discussion related to LGBT pairings and characters in the Harry Potter universe, where all types of pairings and characters are welcome.

As the word “shipping” has different associations, I would be remiss in not mentioning r/Nautical: Reddit’s home for the world of boats, ships and things that float/sink; r/Ships: ships, boats, marine and related for both the enthusiasts and those in the industry; r/Warships: a subreddit dedicated to the discussion of warships, naval history, and life at sea and r/WarshipPorn: dedicated to posting the highest quality & largest images of ships of war.

Cruise ships are also well represented on Reddit.  r/Cruise is a community for sharing cruise-related experiences, opinions, news, etc; and there are many subreddits dedicated to the various cruise lines too.

#Shitpost
::Jargon and Slang::

An accusatory term for a post that’s low effort or intentionally trolling. You can also use the term to describe just casual internet activity; "I'm sat here shitposting all day cause I'm so bored". Not necessarily a low quality post *per se*, there are numerous examples of "quality shitposts" that had a lot of thought put into them and are legitimately entertaining, but can still be called shitposts because the content of the post is outlandish, offensive, or off-topic.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Reddit has far too many shitposting subs for me to even start listing them here, with the obvious exceptions of r/shitpost and r/shitposting.

#Sidebar
::General Guides::

Also known as the “About” tab on mobile. This is the list of essential information pertaining to a specific subreddit, which is presented in segments called “widgets”. On desktop, this will be on the [right-hand side of the sub](https://imgur.com/a/nWKrU0z). At the top of the sidebar you will find a link to [submit a post](https://i.redd.it/hvmi8onozcd91.jpg) and the link to join or leave that subreddit. Underneath that it generally lists the rules, guidelines, relevant information, similar subreddits, Moderator list etc., and it also held the “power-ups” information for the sub before that feature was discontinued.

All subreddits come with an *About Community* widget at the top and a *Moderators* widget at the bottom, followed by one containing essential links to Reddit’s terms and conditions at the very bottom. These can not be reordered or removed.  However, up to 20 additional widgets can be added, and these optional widgets can be placed in any order the mods desire. The mods of the subreddit can set the text in all the widgets except the Moderators one, the essential links one and the Power-ups one when it applied.

“Old Reddit” was able to carry much more information in its sidebar than “New Reddit”, and the sidebar in some subreddits even encourages you to switch to Old Reddit to enhance the experience. Always read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) before commenting or posting on an unfamiliar Subreddit.

#“Sir, this is a Wendy's”
::Lore and History::

This is another of Reddit’s beloved pop-culture references, and is used to imply that [someone is ranting about something in a totally inappropriate place](https://english-grammar-lessons.com/sir-this-is-a-wendys-meaning/). The use of the phrase “Sir, this is a Wendy's” asks us to imagine someone giving an impassioned monologue on their divorce, politics, or something equally involved, while the scene slowly widens out to reveal they’re at the head of a line, talking to a fast-food employee, showing us that it's neither the time nor the place for that kind of rant.

The meme has been around for a long time, but by far the [best researched explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidquestions/comments/o1lu6s/where_did_the_meme_sir_this_is_a_wendys_start/) of its origins I’ve ever seen was given in June 2021 by intrepid Redditor u/8449717, which I quote:

>Some people claim it started with an episode of The Office \[American version\] that [aired in 2007](https://youtu.be/ONn7lNA89wU). The quote: "Dude, this is a Wendy's restaurant," may be similar, but the context is actually different than the current meme (the caller is mistaking Wendy's for someone named Wendy).  
>  
>[Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sir-this-is-an-arbys) attributes it to a Twitter joke using the punchline, "This is an Arby's." It's crazy because it's a different restaurant, but this origin is actually closer to the current meme, because the context is the same: someone monologuing, then being told to order.  
>  
>My personal opinion is that people read the Twitter joke and began to use that on that platform, and then when it was first brought to Reddit it was changed to Wendy's either by mistake or because the OP watched The Office. Then, as Twitter became more political, the meme spread quickly on Reddit and died out elsewhere leading to the current "Sir, this is a Wendy's" format being dominant.  
>  
>There's also the slight possibility that the memes developed at around the same time but independently, but with how much reposting is a problem nowadays, I think the likelihood of the same joke developing twice is low. And as someone [on Quora pointed out](https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-original-Sir-this-an-Arbys-or-Sir-this-is-a-Wendys), the Wendy's meme was [around first](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c3d4e8c9ce7e67e5af6ee8db4d38c400).

The Reddit usage of this phrase, according to a different entry on [Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sir-this-is-a-wendys), can be traced back to the comics artist u/SrGrafo who made a post in February 2019 [called ‘Airport Security’](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/anfdn3/comment/efsvk9x/) that was developed further [after a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/SrGrafo/comments/ankisg/sir_this_is_a_wendys/) was made in reply.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/SrGrafo is the hub for SrGrafo related content, while r/sirthisisawendys demands ‘Sir this IS a Wendy's, so are you either gonna buy something or not so I can get you out?’ And of course, r/wendys is the subreddit dedicated to anything and everything about Wendy's.

Fast food is well catered for (heh) in Reddit, with subreddits ranging from r/fastfood for news, reviews, and discussions of fast food (aka quick-service), fast casual, and casual restaurants; r/TalesFromFastFood for stories from working in fast food restaurants; r/FastFoodFails for when fast food goes wrong, and r/90sfastfood for the nostalgic sharing of 90s fast food commercials, promos, toys, pictures etc.  r/AskReddit takes an [occasional look](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sh6ehl/what_is_the_most_overrated_fast_food_restaurant/) at Reddit opinions on fast food in general.

Individual fast food outlets will have subreddits dedicated to them, such as r/McDonalds, r/McLounge for open discussion between employees of McDonalds, and r/McDonaldsEmployees: a place for employees of McDonalds to share their experience, memes, and ask questions! There’s also r/mcnuggets for all things McNugget. Other fast food outlet subreddits are available from a search bar near you.

#SJW
::Acronyms and Initials::

A perjorative, short for “Social Justice Warrior”.  [Almost always an insult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice_warrior) or mocking term for one who is seen as being [extra progressive or left-wing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/what-does-social-justice-warrior-sjw-mean) or overly enthusiastic about issues of fairness in the treatment of matters of race, gender, or identity.

What it refers to on Reddit appears to range from "crazy person who takes everything as a personal insult and uses the rhetoric of social justice to bully people" to “people who claim to advocate for civil rights, but don't take action and deliberately attack other well-meaning people along the way” through “those who use public ridicule and condescension as their primary tactic against any advocate who makes the slightest misstep” to "any person whose politics are left of mine". None of those are my words but are all definitions I found in my travels across Reddit.

Keep in mind in any debate, throwing an accusation around is easier than refuting it, and the use of pejorative labels or ensnaring the debater in logical fallacies is a favourite diversionary tactic on Reddit.

#SMH
::Acronyms and Initials::

“Shaking My Head”. An initialism used to convey incredulity, disbelief or disappointment. You didn’t know this already? SMH

---

Smol

If it’s small, it’s *small*. If it’s smaller than small, it’s *tiny*. If it’s both small and cute, it’s *smol*. If it’s both smaller than small and cute, it’s *illegally smol*. Yes, here’s another example of [“Doggo Speak”](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_.201Cdoggo_speak.201D), an affectionate misspelling of certain words describing cute animals or objects to make them even cuter.

When referring to something as ‘smol’, the user typically infers that, if given the chance, they’d love to snuggle, cuddle, and fiercely protect said precious animal or object. I defy anyone to say otherwise when viewing r/Illegallysmolcats where cats are so adorably smol it should be illegal; r/IllegallySmolDogs for dogs that are criminally small or r/IllegallySmolBunnies for illegally small bunnies.

You can also discuss the most criminal elements of the sky at r/Illegallysmolbirbs, and for all smol things in general, there’s r/smol and r/IllegallySmol, and because hoomans (sorry) start off smol, there’s r/SmolHumans too. Other smol critters can be found at r/Tinyanimalsonfingersand r/TinyUnits.

On animal subs, using Markdown Text to give the following one word reply in tiny text is often acceptable:

#smol
::Jargon and Slang::

The markdown to create tiny text is to type the \^ symbol twice directly before each word you want to shrink down.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Smol animals need things; they just need tinier things than most. Tiny groceries, tiny phones, tiny violins; the list goes on and on, and r/ThingsForAnts is a showcase for the smol stuff. r/Miniworlds is a treasure trove of miniature landscapes, tiny discoveries or scaled-down creations you could get lost in for hours, while r/booknooks might just become your new favourite obsession.

Giants also need things, they just need bigger things than most. Big groceries, big tools, big slippahs; the list goes on and on, and r/threetimesbigger is a showcase for things at least three times bigger than normal. If larger things are unsettling, try r/megalophobia instead.

r/Tinycatsinbigspaces is a community to appreciate all kinds of felines, in tiny to HUGE ratio of their surroundings; r/babybigcatgifs is a place to see incredibly pathetic roars that eventually turn into cute yawns, and r/illegallybigcats collect chonkers.

#Snoo
::Features of Reddit::

[The Reddit alien mascot logo](https://i.imgur.com/QCLf8Yn.png). Snoo represents Reddit’s friendly, conversational community aspect. The name "Snoo" (short for "What's new") is a derivative of [an early name for Reddit prior to its launch](https://imgur.com/a/Yf4Hs/layout/blog). Sometimes, we Redditors are referred to as “Gentlesnoos”. In the more refined subs, of course.

#Snoovatar
::Features of Reddit::

Launched in [October 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/jip5qu/announcing_reddits_new_avatar_builder/), a Snoovatar is your very own Reddit Snoo designed by yourself from a huge range of mix-and-match “dress-up” options to add to your profile. A small “head and shoulders” vignette of your Snoovatar also appears next to your username on posts and comments. Reddit Premium subscribers get many more options to choose from and a sparkly glow on their Snoovatars.

Those who have been gifted small periods of Premium by receiving premium awards will also unlock these options, but once their time of Premium ends, the premium options will be locked again and anything chosen will disappear from their snoo too. This does glitch from time to time though, and often people are left with a premium option on their snoo - until they change it and find they can’t get it back. There is a “wardrobe” where any previous outfits are stored automatically, but you can only retrieve them from that storage facility if you have a paid Reddit Premium account.

* **Creating your Snoovatar**

To create [a personalised Reddit Snoo](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043035352-How-do-I-customize-and-style-my-avatar-), you need to go to your [Profile](https://i.redd.it/5clbyetau8w81.jpg) where you’ll see an option “Style Avatar”. Selecting this will bring up four options:

* [Shop](https://i.redd.it/aiz3mivi5rd91.png) (more on this below)
* [Explore](https://i.redd.it/3dxao2zy5rd91.png) for a selection of specially created sets
* [Style](https://i.redd.it/ufokgfa36rd91.png) where you can mix and match from lots of options
* [You](https://i.redd.it/f0gcz1qn9rd91.png) where you can fine tune the features of your snoo and can even revisit your [previous designs](https://i.redd.it/crf2m5x66rd91.png).

You might see messages like "A Gift from Above" or “Click to get Treasure” on your profile at some time. If you click on it, it will give you a randomised outfit. To change the cosmetics options, click on “Style Avatar”, go to whatever clothing item section you want removed (let's say tops) and scroll down until you find the outfit your character is wearing, [click the outfit again and it should remove it](https://imgur.com/a/x0bbGkc).

You can also try on a look from another Redditor’s avatar and save it as yours. If you see one you like, just go to their Profile page and click their avatar, where you’ll be presented with a menu as to what aspects you wish to try. You won’t be able to save any Premium (if you don’t have Reddit Premium) or NFT options this way, however. You should also note that the Reddit Avatar Shop rotates its selections and if you change your mind and want to revert back to your original avatar, you might find that some of your previous options are no longer available or have been set to Premium.

* **Blockchain comes to Reddit**

In July 2022, Reddit [announced](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/blockchain-backed-collectible-avatars-coming-to-reddit-via-new-storefront) the imminent launch of Collectible Avatars - limited-edition avatars made by independent artists, [in partnership with Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/vtkmni/introducing_collectible_avatars/). For more information, see the entry on [Collectible Avatars](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_collectible_avatars).

* **Obligatory Warning Notice:**

I would advise that before giving any money to Reddit, please familiarise yourself with the [Reddit Premium and Virtual Goods agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/premium-and-virtual-goods-agreement).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Show off your creations at r/snoovatars, or feast your eyes on the profile of the incredibly talented u/GORBO_the_GREAT to see awesome ones we probably couldn’t officially have due to licensing agreements.

#Snowclone
::Jargon and Slang::

You’ve seen them, you were bemused by them, you just didn’t know what they were called. You already know what a [Snowclone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowclone) *is*, probably just not its name. Coined by American linguists [Geoffrey K. Pullum and Glen Whitman](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000350.html), the term came from needing a name for “...a multi-use, customizable, instantly recognizable, time-worn, quoted or misquoted phrase or sentence that can be used in an entirely open array of different jokey variants by lazy journalists and writers.” Notable examples of Snowclones include:

* “In space, no one can hear you X” (or even “In X, no one can hear you Y”)
* “X is the new Y”
* “The mother of all X”
* “To X or not to X”
* “Have X, will travel” (or even “Have X, will Y”)
* “I, for one, welcome our new X overlords.”

Snowclone variants are usually rooted in [pop-culture references](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/snowclone), making them an ideal Reddit response to most situations, often prompting a Comment Chain where ‘X’ and ‘Y’ refer to whatever the post was about.

#Sock Puppet
::Jargon and Slang::

In Internet terms, sock puppets are [online identities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account) used to disguise activity by the operator, most commonly for purposes of deception. The term is a reference to the manipulation of a simple [hand puppet made from a sock](https://www.handmadecharlotte.com/7-diy-sock-puppets/). Online Sock Puppetry can range from being:

* Mostly Harmless - Where a member of an Internet community creates an alternate identity for the purposes of speaking to, or about, themselves while pretending to be another person.
* Deception Scams - Where someone is promoting [fake merchandise disguised as a Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/crappyoffbrands/comments/gh2af2/tshirt_scams_and_the_likes/)with two or three immediate sock puppet replies: one posting the product, another asking for a link and yet another offering the link or thanking the OP profusely for providing the link.
* Manipulation Tactics - Where someone is Astroturfing; the underhand practice of using alternate accounts [for disinformation purposes](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/blogs/norton-labs/identifying-sockpuppet-accounts-social-media) or to manipulate public opinion by praising, defending, supporting, rubbishing or denigrating a person or organisation.
* Fraudulent Claims - Where [false legitimacy is given](https://www.vice.com/en/article/438v7j/inside-a-reddit-sockpuppet-operation-spam-upvote-shadowbanned) to a phenomenon or product in order to generate public interest and buzz.

Reddit does not take kindly to [sock puppets](https://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/2evazn/sockpuppet_handling/) and you might even fall foul of our Ban Evasion or Vote Manipulation rules if you use an Alt account in this way. So don’t do it, [even in fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/pxt8wz/what_is_this/).

#Sort
::General Guides::

Your Reddit feed of joined subreddits has a drop-down “Sort By” or “View” menu to sort posts by, which in mid 2022 was moved [into Settings](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/vbijg1/changelog_feed_settings_update_and_talk_live_bar/).

This might be different depending on which version of Reddit you’re using, but on mobile, click on your avatar to go to your [profile menu](https://i.redd.it/5clbyetau8w81.jpg) then go to Settings. You’ll see an option called Feed Settings, and there is a drop-down menu under [Home feed sort](https://i.redd.it/m9687kqwm3e91.png). Yes, I am that brave soul that sorts Reddit by New as default.

* **Subreddit Post Sort**

Each subreddit has a separate [feed sort menu](https://i.redd.it/zx4xexot74e91.png) to sort the posts within that subreddit. The options and criteria are much the same as on the overall feed sort.

One other option you might encounter in a subreddit is “Contest Mode”. This isn’t something you can either choose or change, but is a moderator-only option which is really interesting but rarely used. While this mode is enabled, it randomises the comment order every time the page is viewed. No posts will appear to have been upvoted or downvoted even if they have, because the mods have chosen this mode to hide them - usually for a contest or competition, hence the name. Once the mods change the post out of Contest Mode you’ll get to see the vote counts and be able to sort the comments as normal.

* **What do the options do?**

To the best of my understanding, the categories mean:

* Best: Posts with the highest amount of replies and ratio of upvotes to downvotes.
* Hot: Posts that are popular right now.
* New: Recently made posts.
* Top: The most popular posts ever in a subreddit.
* Controversial: Posts that are receiving a relatively equal amount of upvotes and downvotes.
* Rising: Posts that are currently receiving a lot of upvotes.
* **Is there a right way to sort?**

That’s a good question [often asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1y8rst/what_is_the_best_way_to_sort_top_best_new/) and the general conclusion is this: [nobody knows](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1u0q4s/eli5_difference_between_best_hot_and_top_on_reddit/).

* You should note that sorting by anything but Hot may accidentally bypass Pinned posts which contain additional information about the sub that the mods want you to know.
* Sorting by New can sometimes show low quality or spam posts before they get removed by the subreddits’ automod, which might be a little *too* interesting in some subs.
* Sorting by Rising can often be hugely rewarding when you are one of the first to comment on ‘that’ new post that blows up.
* Sometimes when you’re sorting comments by Best, you’ll see that there are comments with higher upvote counts that are not the “best” comment. There is a lot of overlap between Best and Hot which has [a kind of explanation here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/7spgg0/best_is_the_new_hotness/).

Because everyone wants different things from their Reddit experience, there really is no “right way” to sort. For myself, I tend to sort by Hot in an unfamiliar sub to see the Pinned post along with the busy (and perhaps higher quality) posts; Rising for a good mix of all kinds of posts; Controversial when I want to see some unpopular opinions and New by default because it’s chaotic but (mostly) fun. YMMV.

#Spam
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

[Tinned](https://time.com/4827451/spam-history-80th-anniversary/) processed meat? [A Monty Python sketch](https://vimeo.com/329001211) from the 1970s?  [Unsolicited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spam) commercial email? [Or all of the above?](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/09/how-the-word-spam-came-to-mean-junk-message/)

On Reddit, spam consists of posts that contain unofficial advertisements, links to malicious websites, trolling and abusive or [other unwanted information](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043504051-What-constitutes-spam-Am-I-a-spammer-). This can include [self-promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion)and if over 10% of your submissions and conversation are your own site/content/affiliate links, you're almost certainly a spammer.

Reddit is also plagued by spambots. Some have hijacked legitimate Reddit accounts to bypass our Karma restrictions. Some of them will repost a relevant picture from the sub they are in but with the name of a shill website embedded or even posted back to front to avoid the spam filter. Some of them use the Follow option to spam huge tranches of Redditors in one go with the promise of “chat” or porn. If you come across one, use the [Report option](https://i.redd.it/k732ju47qhw81.jpg) in the three dots “Hamburger” Post Overflow Menu.  r/TheseFuckingAccounts is a place to submit and track "suspicious" Reddit accounts.

Incidentally, did you know there are [only six ingredients in tinned Spam](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/73s5k0/til_there_are_only_six_ingredients_in_spam_ham/)? A foodstuff long beloved [in Hawaii](https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/05/i-love-spam-hawaiians-are-ahead-of-the-curve-in-their-celebration-of-the-canned-meat.html), it’s even available there in [several different flavours](https://www.food8ndtrips.com/all-the-many-flavors-of-hawaiian-spam/).

#Spambots
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Seen anyone displaying Van Gogh style [“Starry Night”](https://i.redd.it/lmwef426nad91.jpg) print/canvas posts, pop-culture themed [mugs](https://i.redd.it/savglvqloig91.jpg) or cool [retro print T-shirts](https://i.redd.it/uo161kjii2g91.png), with a link to buy them? Congratulations, you’ve found a Spambot.

Firstly, [what is a Spambot](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/bots/what-is-a-spambot/)? They’re bad news. And the even worse news? We have plenty of them on Reddit, especially on [fandom](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewitcher3/comments/k03w75/how_to_spot_a_scam_seller/), game, [hobby](https://www.reddit.com/r/Falconry/comments/lkhyyj/we_get_hit_with_the_scam_tshirt_credit_card/) or cute animal subreddits.

Spambots are fake Redditors; sometimes powered by computer programs / scripts that mimic real-life user behaviour to spread malicious or illegal content which operate with little to no human involvement.

Spambots on Reddit are not always [easy to spot](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/5fcz3m/there_is_so_much_spam_on_reddit_how_can_we/), and are becoming more prevalent [as time goes on](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/8l1r2k/psa_karma_bots_are_becoming_a_lot_more_prevalent/). In 2019, r/KarmaCourt dealt with a case about spambot accounts which [makes for fascinating reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/dbg7im/myself_ukarmabotkiller_and_the_fine_folks_at/). Many subs are aware of this and actively try to [combat the activity](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/wga2s7/spambot_network_avoiding_sub_filters/) where they can.

Reddit’s spambots come in several varieties:

* **Merchandising Spambots and Shills**

More often than not, these will post an innocent looking picture of a t-shirt or mug with a [non-committal title](https://www.reddit.com/r/terriblefacebookmemes/comments/t7j0yl/the_unreservedly_cutest_thing_ever/hzi46zz/). Shortly after, a different “shill” account will admire it, then [a third account will post a link](https://i.redd.it/tawq6mzrl1m91.jpg). All three will be connected; either one account with two Alts acting as “sock-puppets” or be part of the same ring of spambots. Some bots will repost a [relevant picture from the sub they are in](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatSlaps/comments/noeft6/cat/) with instructions or the name of their website embedded or even posted back to front to avoid the spam filter. Sometimes, the bot OP will direct the unwary Redditor to a pinned post on their profile containing a link.

Be very wary of any posts displaying cool merch such as mugs, prints, stickers, [*Starry Night* wall posters](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/nmvndw/whats_up_with_all_the_starry_night_prints_for/) \- in fact basically anything saying [“Very pleased with my purchase!”](https://www.reddit.com/r/KneadyCats/comments/tdwe85/very_pleased_with_my_purchase_quality_is_good_and/) “Look what arrived today”, [“I’m so pleased with how it came out”](https://i.redd.it/bnneu2fhr7m91.jpg) or similar phrases, and never ever reply to ask where you can get one as some subreddits will instantly permaban you as an accomplice (or “shill”) of the spambot *even if you aren’t*. If you see one, use the “Report” option below the post or in the [three-dots Hamburger Menu](https://i.redd.it/k732ju47qhw81.jpg) as Spam --> Link Farming to alert the mods of that sub.

In all of these scenarios, the items won’t actually exist and it is highly likely that the link will lead you to dodgy advert, phishing, dropship or credit-card scam sites, usually with a Gearlaunch storefront. [Why you should not buy T-shirts/hoodies/mugs linked in comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/httyd/comments/cl3el6/). If you see “Powered By Gearlaunch” on the bottom of a [merch website](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearlaunchSpam/comments/prvtbq/if_you_see_powered_by_gearlaunch_its_100/), don’t be tempted. Find out why at r/GearlaunchSpam.

Some subreddits such as r/UmbrellaAcademy have found merch spambots to be such a problem that they have Automod spot these posts and issue a warning. Not many others do, so you need to be vigilant.

* **Porn, or “Chat” Shill**

These will be newer accounts which use the Follow option to spam the Chat inboxes of huge tranches of Redditors in one go with the promise of “chat” or porn. It often works by sending a provocatively posed semi nude photo, then asks you to click a link to check out more. The link then leads to fake video calling apps or other dodgy websites with the intention of phishing, credit-card scamming, offering “limited time offers” that can’t be gotten out of, or spreading malware or ransomware.

Another scam involves accounts that pretend to be sex workers, usually to resell stolen pics or pretending to be them. Discreetly report incidents of this at r/pornscam.  r/Fightcampiracy is an anti cam-piracy subreddit and non-profit organization managed by cam models to keep up the fight against illegal websites that are stealing cam models' shows.

“Leakgirls” spam is also [prevalent on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/l3h3em/what_to_do_about_the_leakgirlscom_spam/), and one trick they do is mirror popular posts on subreddits, changing one letter in the title, and then reposting while adding the shady link to the bottom of the picture as seen in the more [recent examples linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/svzpn3/the_leakgirls_spammers_have_returned/).

* **Virus Spammers**

You should also beware of leaving Reddit to view a video link as we’ve also been [targeted by a Virus spammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/ndzpi8/spammer_that_keeps_posting_a_cf_website_links/) in the past.

* **Karma Farming Bots**

There’s so much to say about karma bots, I have to address them right from the start [in the introduction to Reddit Karma](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/p8t966/reddit_and_karma_explained/h9sqcti/).

To avoid being mistaken for one, never post or comment in subs offering upvotes or karma. Those subs aren’t just regular new people looking for affirmation; they’re widely used by marketers and political groups with things to promote illicitly on Reddit. Many of the higher scoring posts will be bot or Alt accounts engaged in a “voting-go-round”; anyone innocently blundering into them get many promises but very few actual upvotes.

#Spambot Spotting
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

By now, most people know that e-Mail or text message scammers are actively seeking gullible over unwary people. When they spoof large companies, the text or mail will contain some deliberate spelling mistakes to filter their target audience, because if you are clever enough to realise it’s spam, you are likely too clever to fall for the ensuing scam and they don’t want to waste any more time with you. However, on Reddit, Spambots try to look like real Redditors, and for the most part, they succeed but there are [still some clues to their identity to be found](https://www.reddit.com/user/Someoneman/comments/q3mxam/guide_to_recognizing_spambots/).

* **OP Not Interacting With Comments**

Is the post a “hit-and-run” or is the OP actively engaging in the comments? Most Redditors love a bit of engagement and new Redditors even more so. One of the questions I often get asked are along the lines of “is it weird to want to reply to every single comment on my post?”. So, when a fairly new account or even a fairly dormant old account makes a post that has a few replies, it would be fair to expect the OP to say some extra things in the comments. If the OP has vanished or just says one vague, poorly worded reply to one of the first comments, [they may never have been an real OP in the first place](https://www.reddit.com/user/tyrannosnorlax/comments/t0h466/bots_how_to_identify_them_and_why_do_they_exist/).

* **Odd User History**

It’s normally rare to look through a Redditor’s user history when interacting with them. It does happen occasionally that someone you’re currently disagreeing with will take a look at your past interactions to try and find something political or polarising to throw into the debate to distract or discredit you, but for the most part, nobody actually cares about what, where or when you post or comment outside of the current interaction you’re having.

However, spambots often behave in similar ways to each other, and each behavioural trait becomes obvious [once you know what you’re looking for](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/3jss04/meta_spammers_how_they_work_and_how_to_spot_them/). This makes a spambot account easy to spot, because they will generally have [at least three telltale things](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/s1ithl/comment/hs8l7k6/) in their user histories: they usually delete all previous posts; their comments will all be [quite generic](https://i.redd.it/xbec61ue68m91.jpg) with no real interactions as such, other than replies to other spam accounts in their ring. Some will even have [quite blatant displays](https://i.redd.it/4b85ikurn2g91.jpg) of nonsense in their user histories where the upvotes will have come from a sock-puppet or another account in their ring.

* **Reposts, Reposts, Reposts**

Repost bots will typically take an old but [high scoring](https://www.reddit.com/r/spiders/comments/wfwyvd/essex_uk_does_someone_know_whats_going_on_here/) post from a subreddit and repost it with exactly the same title, hoping that nobody will recognise it as a repost. Here’s another one that was often seen on Reddit during the pandemic [with exactly the same title and spelling mistake](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=reddit+%22Even+During+A+Freak+Storm+In+A+Pandemic+People+Where+Kind+Enough+To+Find+A+Way+To+Pay+The+Shop+Owner+For+Water%22&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-gb&client=safari). Those who sort by New will naturally upvote such lovely stories, and along with the interactions from those who are unaware - and the few who simply don’t care - that it’s a repost, the Spambot’s user history is now full of comments that are relevant and on topic, enabling its comment history to appear real and its karma count enough to be able to bypass most subreddit limits.

Some spambot accounts go even further and repost old photos but add [captions or random questions from entirely unrelated posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosafetysmokingfirst/comments/odgjik/whats_the_best_way_to_support_a_friend_whos/) to try and combat identical image & text searching. Back in 2016, intrepid Redditor u/N8theGr8 examined the behaviour of such [“Comment Bots” here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/42mkxv/bots_on_reddit_that_try_to_appear_human/) and even created r/spambotwatch to track them.

* **Zombie accounts**

The undead hordes of unused accounts grow larger by the day as Reddit pushes upward past 52 million daily users. Sometimes dormant accounts are reanimated by their owners, but an old account suddenly becoming alive again with a different posting style is more likely to have been hacked and sold on the grey market where they are sold with descriptions like “very active, verified, 25k+ post karma, 225k+ comment karma, 7 gold, natural name, organic only.” These are then used for [crypto scammers](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/ld4a2u/spam_bots_btcdiscusscom/) and [leakgirls spammers](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/mbelxz/leakgirlscom_spammers_are_at_it_again/).

* **Phished Accounts**

In 2021, it was reported that there had been a [phishing scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/o92hem/my_reddit_account_got_deleted_for_no_reason/h38xlwx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) where scam hyperlinks were posted in comments, leading to a fake Reddit login page. This collected information so that the phisher could go into the user’s account and lock them out by changing the password. This allowed them to use the accounts to spam NSFW posts, and the genuine users lost their accounts completely. If you’re asked to log into anything from a link whether it be Reddit or a website you want to visit, leave the post and go to the app or site directly instead.

If you are sure you have come across a spambot or shill, use the “Report” button. If you aren’t quite sure, see if anyone else mentions them at r/botwatch or r/TheseFuckingAccounts. The entry “Spambot Spotting Resources” details other Reddit resources and campaigns that try to combat this scourge.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Reddit loves being meta, and to see a glorious example of it in action, [look no further than this parody of a typical t-shirt spam post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDITNAME/comments/wdmjnw/title_containing_phrase_related_to_subreddit/).

#Spambot Spotting Resources
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

If you come across a Spambot, do not engage with it. Use the ‘report’ option below the post or in the [three-dots Hamburger Menu](https://i.redd.it/k732ju47qhw81.jpg) as Spam --> Link Farming to alert the mods of the sub you spotted it on and move on. The only reply you should legitimately make is to warn other users with a link to r/TheseFuckingAccounts and maybe even one of the other initiatives currently fighting against these shills, if relevant.

[How to identify Repost Bots on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Squorlple/comments/ryv2mk/how_to_identify_repost_bots_on_reddit/) is a very useful guide to spotting their activity, as is [How to recognize these accounts](https://www.reddit.com/user/Impossible-Cod-3946/comments/s4nyst/how_to_recognize_these_accounts/) and the excellent [Guide to recognising spambots](https://www.reddit.com/user/Someoneman/comments/q3mxam/guide_to_recognizing_spambots/).

* r/TheseFuckingAccounts \- This is the main place to submit and track suspicious Reddit accounts.
* r/botwatch \- This sub is dedicated to the continued discussion and study of the bots that dwell in Reddit.
* r/KarmaBotKillers \- They have a [useful Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaBotKillers/wiki/index) about accounts that display karma farming bot-like behaviour.

#Spelling and Grammar
::General Guides::

By now you will have realised that Redditors are pedantic when it suits them. Yes, the Grammar Police are coming for you, and when they get here they're going to obliterate you. Unless you bring them first, which is another point of this entry because here, you will learn how to spot some common Reddit pedantry and hopefully even make it work in your favour.

Almost anything in this whole encyclopaedia can be used to throw a conversation off course, which is Reddit’s favourite tactic especially when someone wants to obscure a point because they don’t have a valid counter argument. So, below are a few examples to watch out for or even employ yourself if you’re feeling confident enough to take on - or even join the ranks of the [Reddit Grammar Police](https://tenor.com/view/batman-grammar-gif-10470328).

* **Misconceptions 1: Literal meanings vs. Modern usage**

Some things that will trigger the [hordes of pedants](https://i.redd.it/80wrt2xxcu191.jpg) to smother you with their linguistic smugness are using the words:

* “literally” when you are talking figuratively.
* “decimated” when you probably mean the destruction of more than one in ten items.
* “irregardless\* because regardless already means “without regard.” The -ir prefix is redundant.
* “poisonous” when you’re talking about a snake bite which is *venomous.*
* “less” when you mean “fewer” - remember: Less dough, fewer rolls.
* “could of” which isn’t the written form of could’ve - the ‘ve contraction is short for *have*. Also:
* “should of”; “would of” (when you mean *should have* or *would have*) may summon the u/of_patrol_bot to correct your grammar.
* “all intensive purposes” when you mean *all intents and purposes* \- when spoken aloud these two phrases sound very similar. Mistakes like these are known as [eggcorns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggcorn).

I list a few more *faux pas* in the entry [Grammar Traps](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/4/#wiki_grammar_traps), and if you really *really* want to wind Reddit users up by either making or correcting a misconception, Wikipedia has thoughtfully provided you with a treasure trove on their page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_common\_misconceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions).

* **Misconceptions 2: American English vs. “The Queen’s English”**

Another fun grammar issue increasingly seen on Reddit is people correcting someone saying they "Could care less". "Could care less" and "Couldn't care less" have come to mean the same thing in modern American English and that misconception is so popular it's now a banned topic on r/badlinguistics along with “literally”.

The Oxford English Dictionary says “irregardless” is “Chiefly North American” and “nonstandard or humorous use” while tracing its first use to 1912, though a similar word, “unregardless,” goes back well into the nineteenth century.  [People have been arguing over it ever since](https://www.cjr.org/language_corner/irregardless-usage-standard-nonstandard.php).

There’s a [popular belief](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9ju72b/is_there_any_truth_to_the_narrative_that_the/) that American English is closer to [1600s and 1700s English](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/comments/4xd7wo/american_english_is_closer_to_1600s_and_1700s/) than modern British English is, and comparisons between the two are almost guaranteed to [provoke a spirited discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/8fhl7n/the_american_accent_is_actually_the_original/).

* **Misconceptions 3: English doesn’t change**

Actually, it’s in the nature of English to change. Centuries of invasions, occupations, treaties, settlers, and worldwide explorations brought many new words and concepts to the U.K. and [this superb article](https://www.thedailymeal.com/eat/why-pig-meat-called-pork) addresses the most famous instance of this: why cow meat is called “beef” but chicken meat is called “chicken”.

Many languages evolve over time, and this is known as [semantic change, semantic shift, semantic progression, or semantic development](https://www.thoughtco.com/how-the-meanings-of-words-change-1692666). There is a very good argument to be made that out of my examples above, “literally” and “decimated” are increasingly becoming [Janus Words](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/words-own-opposites) and the mention of this in itself should be enough for you to get out the popcorn and wait for Reddit’s Fine Linguists to show up in droves.

One objection to “irregardless” becoming a Janus Word is that we already have “regardless” that means the same thing, so why do we need another? However, English is full of similar words, some less common than others, like “incent” for “incentivise,” itself just another word for “motivate.” And of course we have countless [synonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym) \- words or phrases that mean exactly or nearly the same as other words, morphemes, or phrases in a given language.

* **Misconceptions 4: English shouldn’t change**

The first three misconceptions above rely on trying to give the English language a firm and immutable set of rules. The argument that we shouldn’t stop semantic development is simply and elegantly demonstrated at [Grammarphobia](https://www.grammarphobia.com/grammar-html) where they split infinitives and end sentences with prepositions with impunity - and prove it makes perfect sense to do so.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/speling have been “messing with gramar nazis since 2012 by celebrating all speling mistakes”, while r/badgrammar is a place to showcase the worst of bad spelling, grammar, or English in general.  r/NYTSpellingBee is for discussion of the daily New York Times Spelling Bee puzzle and r/spelling is for all things spelling.

For a more academic tone, r/linguisticshumor had fun with a proposal for [English Etymological Spelling Reform](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguisticshumor/comments/boc9hl/%C3%A6nglisc_%E1%BC%90%CF%84%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%BAal_speling_r%C3%A9forme/). Similarly, r/grammar had a discussion on whether something is [“spelled” or “spelt”](https://www.reddit.com/r/grammar/comments/32cenx/not_sure_if_i_should_use_spelled_or_spelt_when/) and for *actual* spelt, r/Breadit (a community for anything related to making homemade bread) [is your delicious destination](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/ggz5t4/any_experience_with_spelt_flour/).

#Spelling and Punctuation
::General Guides::

Do please proofread your submissions. Reddit is actually quite tolerant of a couple of typos or a few grammar or punctuation mistakes, but will also jump on one with glee if they find one in a serious case you may be putting forward in order to invalidate your argument and/or derail the discussion; another thing that Reddit is very good at.

It’s fine to ironically misspell a word for comedic effect, so long as it is obviously done that way. If you see an image with a spelling mistake on, it’s The Reddit Way to point it out. Preferred formats for this are commenting the misspelled word as S P E L I N G or even “sPeLiNg”. But in normal Reddit usage, a simple misspelling can sometimes have consequences. Let me demonstrate using a simple six-word statement:

Make sure not to misspell anything.

I may not have misspelled anything in that statement but a pedant could rightly point out that I have made my first grammatical error, as it would be more concise to say "Do not misspell." Words are the only things that can be misspelled so the word "anything" in that sentence is superfluous, and in fact, a pleonasm: a word which adds nothing extra to a sentence.

A pleonasm should not be confused with a tautology; that’s a word which merely repeats the meaning of another word in an expression. These are both, however, cases of redundant words which can be omitted from sentences (the words “from sentences” being another pleonasm as I hope you spotted).

My second error (or my first, should we look at my statement in chronological order) was in saying "Make sure not to", as it is wordy, uncertain, and less comprehensible to Reddit's many fine ESL (English as a Second Language) users or our visually impaired Redditors who rely on using screen-reading text-to-speech software for their Reddit experience.

Still with me through that combo move using Increasingly Verbose / NYTO? Wow. Congratulations! Here’s my poor man’s gold.🥇Yes, Copypasta too.

The best part? I didn’t even spell anything wrong in that statement, but by now the comments will be so wildly entrenched in proving or disproving my subsequent points it simply doesn’t matter anymore. “Less comprehensible” than what, by the way? That’s another grammar slip-up lost in the morass.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/excgarated is for when a misspelling is so bad it's comical, potentially to the extent of being unique in the universe.

#Spelling and Punctuation: Apostrophe Traps
::General Guides::

The most common Apostrophe Trap concerns “it’s” and “its”. A handy mnemonic to stop you falling in is:

* It’s got an apostrophe because it is missing its I.

This falls under the [Apostrophe Rules for Possessives and Contractions](https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/punctuation/apostrophe-rules.html):

1. Use an apostrophe +"s" ('s) to show that one person/thing owns or is a member of something.
2. Use an apostrophe after the "s" (s') at the end of a plural noun to show possession.
3. If a plural noun doesn't end in "s," add an apostrophe + "s" to create the possessive form.

Still confused? [Grammar Monster](https://www.grammar-monster.com/punctuation/apostrophe_after_s.html) have an excellent [illustration](https://i.redd.it/gkavznvb1al91.png) that really helps.

Finally, let’s not address [the ‘Oxford Comma’ just yet](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/u4pro/best_argument_ive_ever_seen_for_the_oxford_comma/). Because sometimes, Reddit [loves the Oxford Comma](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5si0d2/people_of_reddit_whats_your_opinion_on_the_oxford/) and sometimes, Reddit [hates the Oxford Comma](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/agvjsb/the_oxford_comma_shouldnt_be_used/).

There will be more traps to fall into; there will always be more. Have fun finding this out. If it’s you that made the grammatical error and are getting called out, don’t try and act smart or you’ll find yourself a candidate for r/woooosh or r/iamverysmart. Instead, just take it with good humour and move on. Back-pedalling will not end well. Sometimes interwebs people are mean spirited.

#Starter Packs
::Memes and Trends::

In normal everyday life, a starter pack is a set of articles or equipment providing the items and instructions essential for someone taking up a particular activity or starting a process for the first time. I like to think of r/NewToReddit as a starter pack to getting the most out of our little slice of the internet.

However, on Reddit, this is an innocuous phrase that is not quite how it appears. This is another of Reddit’s beloved memes, with homes at r/starterpack and r/starterpacks. This meme consists of a collage of photos meant to describe or illustrate a stereotypical person, place, culture, object, or opinion.  [Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/starter-packs) gives it two origins; one going back to the glorious days of [LOLcats](https://cheezburger.com/9381488640) and a more recent version from 2014 when a Twitter user posted the ["I Date Black Guys” Starter Pack](https://www.reddit.com/r/starterpacks/comments/9kqrzw/the_i_only_date_black_guys_starter_pack/).

One user on the [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Starter%20Pack) sums the development from the original cute observation to the snarky meme it is today like this: *“What was a harmless way of expressing frustration and pointing out stereotypes and clichés has now devolved into setting out and actively insulting anyone who likes things that you may not personally like, for example, collecting images of movies, items of clothing or accessories and writing an insult on the top, such as: ‘Hey look, I made an epic XD Starter Pack meme on how only losers enjoy these type of things!’”*

For a wonderful meta-Reddit Moment, look no further than this [Starter Pack guide to the MillennialRedditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/starterpacks/comments/fowv84/the_millennial_redditor_starter_pack/).

::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

In 2020, Reddit announced in an article for the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddit-claims-52-million-daily-users-revealing-a-key-figure-for-social-media-platforms-11606822200) that *“We’re sharing \[daily active users\] for the first time as a more accurate reflection of our user growth and to be more in-line with industry reporting.”*

Since then, there have [been plenty](https://whydoeseverythingsuck.net/blog/reddit-statistics/) of blogs [analysing](https://thesmallbusinessblog.net/reddit-statistics/) activity and extrapolating [interesting statistics](https://thrivemyway.com/reddit-statistics/) about [Reddit](https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/reddit-stats/) out there. Some of them even have [fun infographics](https://websitebuilder.org/blog/reddit-statistics/).

Statisticians looking for connections can always find odd coincidences and statistical anomalies, if they try hard enough.

* **Statistician, analyse thyself**

By far, the most interesting Reddit statistics are the ones that analyse your own activity. These are external links to obtain various statistics about your Reddit usage. Please note that while incredibly interesting and maybe even useful, none of these are endorsed by Reddit whatsoever.

* [https://redditmetis.com](https://redditmetis.com/) Enter your username to see your Reddit Statistics: recent activity, comment and submissions summaries and more interesting stats. Data is generated from the last 1000 comments and submissions.
* [https://www.redditinvestigator.com](https://www.redditinvestigator.com/) Enter your username and let Reddit Investigator collect the data that Reddit makes available and elaborates it to obtain statistics about your account.

* [https://redective.com](https://redective.com/) The “Reddit Search Detective” which gives a selection of options to search.

These are just a few examples of what I’m given to understand is out there.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/statistics is a subreddit for discussion on all things dealing with statistical theory, software, and application;  r/AskStatistics is to help answer questions about the process of doing statistical analysis and [here’s a list of 8 subs for data science](https://rivery.io/blog/top-8-subreddits-for-data-science/).

#Stonks
::Jargon and Slang::

An intentional misspelling of “stocks” that originated with an [internet meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/stonks). Used in the many [Stock Market subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/comments/ja8du7/list_of_economic_and_stock_market_subreddits/) and throughout Reddit. See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/glossary).

#Strawman Argument
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Very simplistically, this is misrepresenting an argument to make it easier to knock down. "We should give free fruit to school kids", "Yeah, let's just give everyone free food. That would just lead to obesity and a greater deficit".

An accusation of a logical fallacy is often used on Reddit when the OP’s goal of achieving common agreement is more important to them than utilizing sound reasoning.

Reddit, as you would expect, takes this matter Very Seriously Indeed™ and an [excellent explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/qdrdjo/comment/hholzxu/) of the strawman argument turned into a full blown meta Reddit Moment with comment chains full of people practicing strawman arguments. And cats.

Ah, Reddit; never change.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/steelmanning: the steel man argument (or steelmanning) is the opposite of the straw man argument. The idea is to find the best form of the opponent's argument to test opposing opinions. The purpose of this subreddit is to collectively create the strongest version of arguments even if it is an argument you disagree with.

#Streisand Effect
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, the [Streisand Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) is an attempt to hide, remove, or censor information which then backfires to have the unintended consequences of publicising it instead.

In 2003, Barbra Streisand [sued photographer Kenneth Adelman](https://www.californiacoastline.org/streisand/slapp-ruling-tentative.pdf) for distributing aerial pictures of her mansion in Malibu. However, this wasn’t the usual case of celebrity snooping by unscrupulous paparazzi; the photographer was working on the California Coastal Records Project, a resource providing more than 12,000 pictures of the California coast for scientists and researchers to use to study coastal erosion. At the time of the lawsuit, the picture in question had apparently only been accessed a total of six times, two of which by Streisand’s lawyers. Of course, news outlets around the world reported on Streisand’s outrage, and before long, [the photo](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/streisand-effect) had received well over a million views. The photo was also picked up by the Associated Press and was reprinted countless times.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/Streisandeffect appears to have been dormant for a couple of years, but used to document instances of this phenomenon. The fandom subreddit r/BarbraStreisand also appears to be dormant. Abandoned subreddits can be adopted and given life again; full details are given in [Creating A Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_creating_a_subreddit).

#Subscribers
::General Guides::

On the top of a subreddit page you’ll see the number of members that subreddit currently has subscribed to it. Here’s what it looks like on [Mobile](https://i.redd.it/zmi1iqgf19l91.jpg) and on [Browser](https://i.redd.it/ey07t3fl39l91.jpg). These screenshots were taken shortly after we at r/NewToReddit celebrated our 30,000th subscriber [in August 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/wjk3uc/30000_member_party/). But at the time of those screenshots, did we really have 31,099 members, and were there 49 or 50 of them online at that particular moment?

* **That’s a good question…**

Firstly, not everyone who is "online" has to be a subscriber. Because r/NewToReddit is a public subreddit, users do not have to subscribe to it to look at content posted there. We have no way of telling if those 49 or 50 Redditors are members or not, and it doesn’t really matter that much anyway. As I said in [**Reddit and Karma Explained**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/p8t966/reddit_and_karma_explained/), *Moderators cannot see any lists of those who are joined to their subreddits, neither will they be notified if anyone leaves. You don’t even have to be joined in a sub to post or comment in it.*

Secondly, just like the upvote and downvote figures are “fuzzed”, so are the number of users [shown to be online](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/yjk55/proposed_change_to_the_users_online_count_for_low/), and have been [since late 2012](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/yneqk/reddit_change_users_online_text_adjusted_value/).

* **That’s a good answer!**

…to the puzzlement of many who have their own private subreddit, who are often alarmed to see [1 members, 4 online](https://i.redd.it/o9a9k2pag9x81.jpg), as shown on this screenshot from my own private subreddit I use for images used in my guides. While it looks like I have one subscriber and four people are viewing my sub at that moment, the number of people viewing is fuzzed by Reddit, so it might say anything up to nine or even down to 0, even when there is actually just one there - me. Don’t forget, Admins can see inside private subreddits without an invite needed, but the chances of that happening are highly unlikely.

* **It doesn’t say “Members” or “Online” on every subreddit.**

Sometimes subs have [custom headings](https://www.reddit.com/r/modguide/comments/e4nrql/how_to_change_the_name_of_your_members_and_online/). For instance, r/PhotoshopRequest has “Photoshop Wizards” instead of “Members”, and r/CasualConversation has “conversationalists”.

#Subreddit
::General Guides::

A term for a forum or community on Reddit. Commonly shortened to “sub”.  [As of September 2021](https://frontpagemetrics.com/), Reddit boasts more than 3 million subreddits with 52 million daily active users in more than 130,000 active communities. On average 60,251 new subreddits are [added to Reddit each month](https://backlinko.com/reddit-users).

Find the top growing communities in your favorite category at [https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/leaderboard/](https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/leaderboard/). When you find a sub you want to see more from, click "+Join" to add a sub to your Home feed. When you’re bored of it, the Leave button will be in the same place. You can Join or Leave a sub as many times as you want. There is no limit to the number of subs you can be joined in and nobody will ever know if you have joined or left any particular sub; not even its moderators.

* **Types of subreddit**

Subreddits come in a number of varieties:

* Public: Where anyone can view and submit posts and comments
* Restricted: Where anyone can view but only some are approved to submit
* Private: Where only approved members can view and submit
* Gold: Where only Reddit Premium members can view and submit
* **Your own subreddit**

Anyone on Reddit can have a community of their own! I give more details in [Creating A Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_creating_a_subreddit) and you should also see these articles first:

* [Things to know before creating a subreddit](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001656752-Things-to-know-before-creating-a-subreddit)
* [How to create a subreddit](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001766991-How-to-create-a-subreddit)

There needs to be an ‘Internet Adage’ stating that “If something exists somewhere, there’s already a Subreddit for it”. Prove me wrong, or call it “Llama’s Law”. Either works for me.

#SubsTakenLiterally
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A link or phrase posted when people mistake a Subreddit name for its content. This Subreddit documents the times people took a sub name a bit too literally, e.g. posting fan art of the T.V. Show *Lost* to r/Lostredditors.  r/SubsTakenLiterally.

#Suspicious Activity
::General Guides::

Sometimes an account can be hijacked by a spambot. If you suspect activity on your account that is not your own, you should immediately change your password (and that on your recovery email too just to be safe) and then set up Two-Factor Authorisation. Have a look at this page where you can view any suspicious activity, and log out any other sessions: [https://www.reddit.com/account-activity](https://www.reddit.com/account-activity).

#Switcharoo or "Ah, The Ole Reddit Switch-a-roo"
::Jargon and Slang::

A phrase posted when the post or comment [is a little ambiguous](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1cuklt/found_this_little_fluffball_under_my_house_last/c9kb83c/) and is then deliberately misunderstood in a humorous way.

Basically if anyone calls a switcharoo, they have to link to another comment *anywhere* on Reddit that links to another switcharoo. That way, you can click one which will take you to another, then another, then another and so on. If done properly it should be endless, and there is no telling where you will end up. If you accept the switcharoo challenge, you need to comment "Hold my X I'm going in!" (where X is something relevant to the switcharoo) or the more generic "Hold my beer, I'm going in!" where X wouldn’t be appropriate.

It has an entry on [Know your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-old-reddit-switch-a-roo), and r/explainlikeimfive (ELI5) has an [explanation with notable links](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/17140d/eli5_ol_reddit_switcharoo/). Hold my Encyclopaedia Redditica, I'm going in!  r/switcharoo.
