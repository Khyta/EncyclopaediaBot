#Aardvarks
Reddit loves animals. Reddit loves strangeness. Here, we have both! So why doesn’t r/aardvarks have more love? Find aardvarks, post them there. Please.


#About
::Meta::  
The “About” tab on mobile contains essential information for the sub you are visiting. Also known as Sidebar on desktop. Always read the rules before commenting or posting on an unfamiliar Subreddit. These will be found in the Sidebar (on mobile this will be the About tab, Menu tab (where there is one) and Community Info found in the three dot “hamburger” post overflow menu top RH corner of your screen), any pinned posts (these will have a lime green ‘pin’ icon on the top corner and will show on top when you sort the Subreddit by ‘Hot’) and Wiki (where there is one). Here’s our [comprehensive guide to finding a subreddit’s rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/).

Some subs will have an F.A.Q. List, and many will have a Wiki. Unfortunately for mobile users, a subreddit Wiki is currently not compatible with the official Reddit app. Links given to any part of a Wiki will do one of three things to an app user:

1. Prompt one of the many “this subreddit does not exist” pop-ups.
2. Default to the very top of the wiki regardless of where on the page the link should send you.
3. [Mess up the format completely](https://i.redd.it/944m5oc3wli81.png).

However, opening the Wiki in a browser will work, though not an ideal solution.

#Absolute Unit
::Animals::  
It's as large as life and twice as natural! If it’s big, it can be described as a unit. If it’s really big, it’s an absolute unit. Unless it’s a cat, [in which case it’s a chonk](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/chonk-oh-lawd-he-comin).

Memes, just like every other joke format, don’t exist in a vacuum, which is why being aware of their origins is crucial. While we are happy to use phrases like this as an affectionate way to refer to a large, round animal or object, its origin is far less innocent, being an image of a [large man standing behind the Queen Of England](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/absolute-unit), with the caption, “In awe at the size of this lad. Absolute unit.” Despite having the picture on their heading, [r/AbsoluteUnits](https://www.reddit.com/r/AbsoluteUnits/) are looking for animals mostly, particularly cute animals which happen to be very large. Only public figures are allowed; no harassment, creep-shots, witch-hunts or fat-shaming is allowed.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[r/TinyUnits](https://www.reddit.com/r/TinyUnits/) is a chilled out place for sharing videos, gifs, and images of tiny animals, insects & random objects you find pretty awesome.

#Accidental Alt
::Meta::  
It is possible to have an accidental account on Reddit! This comes as a shock to many people when they discover they’ve inadvertently created a different account by clicking "sign in with Google/Apple". Doing that creates a new, or alternate account (Alt) with a random username, usually consisting of [two unrelated words joined with an underscore or hyphen, followed by a random number](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/n75l53/my_icon_info/).

These automatically generated usernames can be changed within 30 days of account creation by going to your profile where a prompt should appear asking if you would like to keep or change the username. If the prompt does not show up, you may have accidentally chosen to keep the username and you would have to create a new account in order to have another username.

Creating an Alt can happen easily by accident, especially if you're logged in with Chrome, or sometimes on iOS mobile by following a generic link like: [https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile](https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile). To get back to a normal account, stop using the "sign in with Google/Apple ID" option and instead type out your usual username and password combinations.

#accidentalswastika

A link posted when you find an unintentional swastika shape in logos and designs of all kinds. Before posting there, please check the Forbidden Post List at [https://old.reddit.com/r/accidentalswastika/](https://old.reddit.com/r/accidentalswastika/) first, because some Swastikas aren’t unintentional or even malicious. *Sauwastika* are ancient religious symbols used as 卐 by Hindu/Jain (among others) and as 卍 by Buddhists (among others), and until recently, the [“Hakaristi”](http://www.strangehistory.net/2015/02/24/good-swastikas-hakaristi/) was a symbol used by [Finland’s Air Force](https://www.dw.com/en/finlands-air-force-removes-the-swastika-from-logo-after-almost-a-century/a-54020470). Indeed, the swastika shape has a [fascinating history worldwide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika); Context, as always, is everything. [r/accidentalswastika](https://www.reddit.com/r/accidentalswastika/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[r/hailhortler](https://www.reddit.com/r/hailhortler/) is for deliberate attempts at drawing Nazi Swastikas, i.e. the “Hakenkreuz” (hook-cross), that have failed somewhat, and [r/beholdthemasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/beholdthemasterrace/) mocks supremacy according to their sidebar criteria.
