#F or "F" In The Comments
::Culture and Etiquette::

Originally from “Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare” which had a funeral scene with the option “press F to pay respects”. People thought it was funny that they tried to make a cutscene interactive and now use it whenever something bad but funny happens to someone. There’s even [an ‘F’ key Award](https://i.redd.it/jw7dsdxmzzv41.png) to “pay respects”, but trolls occasionally use it in response to genuine tragedy. Don’t be a troll.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Reddit has scores of Subreddits committed to gaming. The broadest of all is r/gaming, while r/GameDeals allows you to filter video game deals by retailers and developers. r/gamedetectives has been "solving ARGs (alternate reality games) since 2015" and r/Gaming4Gamers deems itself a "middle ground between the purely-for-fun Subreddits and the more serious ones. Show off your gaming setup at r/battlestations or construct one at r/buildapc.

#Fake Subreddits
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A single link to another subreddit is often given in a comment when the subject under discussion would fit there too. Yay! A new sub to play in! But you will also find links posted to subreddits that don’t exist; i.e. Fake Subreddits generated by someone putting the prefix r/ before a random word or phrase for comic effect r/likethis_forexample. Welcome to the meta world of fake subreddits: please hold onto your hat.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/SubsIFellFor is a sub dedicated to documenting the times you fell for a fake sub that seemed real in comments but wasn’t.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/subsiwishexisted is a sub dedicated to documenting the times you were disappointed at the times you fell for a fake sub that seemed real in comments but wasn’t.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/subsithoughtifellfor is a sub dedicated to documenting the times you thought you might be falling for a fake sub that seemed real in comments which is indeed real and does actually exist.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/subsyoufellfor is a sub dedicated to bamboozling you into falling for a fake sub that seems real in comments which is indeed real and does actually exist but with no content or purpose other than the bamboozle you were meant to fall for by clicking the sub. Reddit loves being meta. Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/wowthissubexists is a sub dedicated to documenting the times you thought a sub couldn’t possibly exist for something but it does. There really is a subreddit for everything.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/twentycharacterlimit is a sub dedicated to documenting the *Traditional Reddit Reply*™ to someone posting an obviously fake sub name that's too long to be a subreddit.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/21CharactersAndNoMore, and r/21CharacterLimitation are subs dedicated to documenting other examples of subreddit limitations!

#“Fake-Out” Subreddits
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Because there is a Subreddit for everything, we have a fine selection of parody subreddits to peruse. Subreddits that exist not for participating in but quite the opposite include:

* r/Amish
* r/GermanHumor
* r/GoodCardiBSongs
* r/thingsjonsnowknows

There are more of these; there will always be more of these. Let me know if you find any!

#False Equivalence
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Also known as a Formal Fallacy. Very simplistically, this is where you make an argument based on a comparison of traits that misrepresents and mischaracterises those similar traits. For example: Redditors generally like dogs, and Hitler liked dogs, so Redditors are just like Hitler. Another simple example of a false equivalence of the type you’ll often see on Reddit is saying things like because a knife and dynamite are both tools that can be used as weapons, they're pretty much the same thing so because we allow people to buy knives at the store, we should allow them to also buy dynamite there too. Any false equivalence generally exaggerates similarities and ignores important differences.

An accusation of a logical fallacy is often used on Reddit when the OP’s goal of achieving common agreement is more important to them than utilizing sound reasoning. Usually it's done intentionally to detract from or even derail the argument to persuade people that your point of view is the correct one. Reddit is extremely pedantic about logical fallacies, of which this is one. Or is it?

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Catch a fallacy? What type and why? Note and discuss it at r/fallacy.

#Famous Redditors
::Lore and History::

Some very famous people have Reddit accounts. Some, like [Bill Gates](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/m8n4vt/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_and_melinda/), [President Obama](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/) and the late [Stephen Hawking](https://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3nyn5i/science_ama_series_stephen_hawking_ama_answers/cvsdmkv/), hosted an r/IAmA (Bill Gates has done 9 so far!), while others like Rick Astley u/ReallyRickAstley to Wil Wheaton u/wil, and Deadmau5 u/reddit_mau5 can be found in the wild.

There are many celebrity figures to be found in Reddit’s hallowed halls [and they often go unnoticed](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/95qhar/has_there_ever_been_a_secret_celebrity_reddit/), though some are admittedly [more noticeable](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/mfq1h3/arnold_at_the_1975_mrolympia_its_the_only_hd/gsovrw8/).

There’s a [Ranker list](https://www.ranker.com/list/celebrities-on-reddit/celebrity-lists) with some other instances. Often a celebrity will do an r/IAmA session especially if they have something to promote. Look on the Sidebar (or About tab) for forthcoming sessions on r/IAmA.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

You don’t have to be famous to host an AMA. At r/casualiama, anyone's welcome to host or participate in an AMA. Topics may involve anything from ordinary to extraordinary subject matter. It’s even more random over at r/AMA, but it’s still important to read the rules in both subs before contributing.

**See Also:**

#Feeds
::Features of Reddit::

There’s an enormous amount of content on Reddit, which is loosely organised into three main Feeds:

* Home Feed: You curate this feed by clicking "Join" in communities that you want to see more from.
* r/popular \- Diverse and highly upvoted content from communities all over Reddit. All content in this feed comes from SFW (safe for work) communities.
* r/all \- Depending on which order you choose to sort this in, you may see highly upvoted content from all over the site or you may get a glimpse at the stranger side of Reddit in real time as it gets posted.

New users are automatically directed to two top feeds: r/all and r/popular. This is the start of your Reddit Front Page: a personalized homepage view of reddit.com, which includes top posts from all the subreddits you have subscribed to. It should look [a little like this](https://preview.redd.it/bkiygsgoppg61.png?width=3336&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aea23a638d52d6352f6158fa3023ddc0afeed9f).

As you explore Reddit and find more niche communities suited to you, you can join them which will create your personal Home Feed to see popular posts from those subreddits. You can always browse those individual subs directly, of course. You don’t have to join a sub to be able to vote, post or comment, but if you’re not joined to a sub, posts from it won’t form part of your Home Feed.

You are not making any commitment to a sub by joining it, and you can leave or join it as many times as you like and nobody will ever know - not even its moderators. There is no limit on the number of subs you can join, but Reddit does restrict the number of subs that filter to your home feed at any one time.

#Filters
::General Guides::

Old Reddit had a certain functionality that the redesign (New Reddit) or the app doesn’t have, and that is the ability to force certain actions by filter. In the old design, Reddit had a convention to force a certain language for official Reddit action buttons. For example, [https://old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com/) is the old design in general but [https://en.reddit.com](https://en.reddit.com/) is the old design but forced to be in English. Forcing Old Reddit to be in, say, Spanish, would be [https://es.reddit.com](https://es.reddit.com/), but that translation only applies to the action bars and buttons, not the posts or comments.

Some enterprising subs would make their css a certain way to use such url prefixes to make filtering their content easier. The most well known one of these is [https://np.reddit.com](https://np.reddit.com/), used for a "no participation" mode when crossposting a post from another subreddit to make it hard to vote or comment in the original, so they could discuss it without danger of any accusations of Brigading or Vote Manipulation and the consequences thereof. While not required, you can still use Old Reddit to access the NP (No Participation) domain of Reddit when crossposting. The NP domain can be accessed by replacing the "www" in your reddit link with "np".

Some “old school” Redditors still use the letters (NP) in crosspost post titles to warn people against going to participate in the original thread.

Some of these old filters [can still be seen](https://xi.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/ssjxz7/ichigoro_family/). The sub linked above uses "xi" to filter that sub to show only "fanart" tagged posts. You can see in the sidebar of that sub (on the old design at least) an entire "filter" section and can see the different filters use different prefixes.

Other legacy Reddit filters include:

* reddit.com/r/ for subreddit lists including the number of [subs you are currently joined in](https://i.redd.it/epswt472o2w81.jpg)
* reddit.com/random/ for a random post from a random sub each time you click

There may well be others out there too. Let me know if you find any.

#Financial Help on Reddit
::Features of Reddit::

Social media isn’t usually the place for sound advice on real-world problems, but Reddit does have more than its fair share of [communities based on and around financial issues](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/reddit-go-to-source-money-advice-2021-8?r=US&IR=T). There are two kinds of financial help one can get on Reddit: advice and support.

* **Advice**

Subreddits like r/personalfinance (for USA-based discussion), r/eupersonalfinance (for advice on personal finance in EU countries) or r/UKPersonalFinance will help you to learn about budgeting, saving, getting out of debt, credit, investing, and retirement planning. Their sidebars or wiki pages will be a wealth of useful information and links to help you plan your personal finances.

Subreddits like r/finance discuss financial news and views, while r/povertyfinance gives frugality tips, stories, opportunities, and general guidance for people who are struggling financially.

Subreddits like r/FinancialCareers will help plan your career in the wide world of finance and r/financialindependence gives ideas and tips for those who wish to become FIRE: Financially Independent and Retired Early.  [There are many more subs on a wide variety of financial issues](https://onjuno.com/blog/best-money-personal-finance-reddit) and the Search facility will help you locate the ones you want.

**It is important to add here that Reddit is not a source of regulated financial advice, and its contributors may not be qualified in any way.** Treat any information, recommendations or "advice" that you read here with caution and always do your own research before moving ahead with any plans. For personal financial advice, consider seeking out a professional financial adviser.

* **Support**

Everyone needs help sometimes, and Redditors like to help active and contributing members of the community.  r/care is a place for Redditors to get a chance to help other established, active Redditors and give back to the community.  r/assistance also has a useful resource of Subreddits that may be able to help:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1hexgp/other\_subreddits\_that\_can\_help\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1hexgp/other_subreddits_that_can_help_you/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/wiki/index/othersubs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/wiki/index/othersubs).

Other helpful subs include:

* r/Favors
* r/RandomKindness
* r/donationrequest
* r/CashAppDonations
* r/Charity
* r/GoFundMe
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/wiki/directory](https://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/wiki/directory)

r/CasualConversation maintain lists of support resources and subs that may help:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/support](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/support)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/directory](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/directory)

r/beermoney is a community for people to discuss mostly online money-making opportunities to make that little extra cash on the side, and they also have lists of resources:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/wiki/index/](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/wiki/index/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/wiki/faq/sites](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/wiki/faq/sites)

*I must caution you that it is extremely important to read the* [*rules*](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) *carefully before posting in a sub that’s new to you, but especially so in the assistance subreddits where, through necessity, they have to be stricter than most. Some of them will have minimum Karma, account age and participation requirements, and all of them will have rules about Post format.*

* **Warning**

Reddit might be its own self-contained corner of the Internet but we are still subject to many of the [scams and confidence tricks that go on out there](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/p35tef/recent_scams_targeting_the_sub_please_read/). A good general rule to follow in life is “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is” and another one is that “it’s better to miss out on something because of misplaced doubt than to get taken in because of misplaced trust”.

If someone posts, comments or sends you a direct message or chat request asking for money of any amount [for any reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/pluwsn/isnt_soliciting_on_reddit_against_the_rules/) \- no matter how genuine it sounds - please [report them](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058752951-How-do-I-report-a-private-message-), refer them to r/assistance, block them and move on.  r/assistance has a [useful resource of Subreddits that may be able to help them](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1hexgp/other_subreddits_that_can_help_you/) in a controlled manner.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/Scams is the place to let people know about any online, offline, email, SMS or postal scams you might encounter, and r/DontFundMe is a subreddit dedicated to showcasing shameless or particularly egregious GoFundMe projects.

#Flair
::General Guides::

Has two meanings on Reddit; distinguishing your username or categorising your post. Some subreddits require you to have [been given a User Flair by the mods before you can post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/gumxuy/what_is_bpt_country_club_and_how_do_i_get/) to prove you’re a verified user. Some subreddits require you to use a Post Flair and it simply won’t allow you to submit the post without prompting you to choose one.

#Following
::Culture and Etiquette::

Following and messaging other Redditors is currently disabled for new users. It'll eventually unlock when you gain more account age and karma - both of which are unspecified but not too prohibitive.

You should know that ‘following’ is very different here than on any other social media. Reddit is primarily a content sharing platform where we follow Subreddits (or ‘subs’) - communities which are focused on topics. In fact, it’s actually seen by some as a little creepy to follow individual people on Reddit.

You’ll be relieved to hear that you’ll never need to work hard to gain a large following here. You don’t need followers to gain more visibility or to be moved upwards on lists, receive priorities, etc. The number of followers you have doesn’t even show on your public profile to others except yourself, so collecting or soliciting followers serves no actual purpose on Reddit.

‘Following’ isn't even following your every move on Reddit. You won’t get notification that someone has read your post, liked or disliked it or even saved it to their favourites. You will never know if your profile has ever been accessed or by who, nor will you ever know who browsed, liked, disliked, saved or even reported your posts and comments.

There are, however, those who do live streams on Reddit, and if you were to follow them, you’ll get notified when they do a broadcast. Check out r/pan for the rules on live streams.

* **Users you follow**

You used to be able to see the list of the Redditors you follow on mobile by clicking the [‘Square-Circle-Square-Magnifying Glass’](https://i.redd.it/nibfggzbcd281.jpg) icon at the bottom, second from the left, but users of the new interface will have to click the three-line “hamburger” or “drawer” menu on the top LH of the screen which will [slide out the list of your communities](https://i.redd.it/7titwy3thwu81.jpg). They will be in alphabetical order with your “favorites” first, and the users you follow will be listed beneath your subscribed subreddits list.

On desktop, you can click on Home (house or spaceship icon) at the top of the page or if you don’t have these, click [your username on the top RH of the page](https://i.redd.it/hnqyrku7jwu81.jpg) or the subreddit [name on the top RH of the page](https://i.redd.it/mj046rqoxwu81.jpg) and the drop down menu lists your communities; again in alphabetical order with your favourites first and the Redditors at the bottom.

On Old Reddit: [https://old.reddit.com/subreddits/](https://old.reddit.com/subreddits/) your subscribed subreddits list is on the [right-hand side of the screen](https://i.redd.it/epswt472o2w81.jpg), where those you follow will be listed as if they were subreddits that begin with ‘u’. Nobody can see this list except you.

* **Users following you**

Until 2020, you couldn’t actually tell who was following you. Reddit started sending notifications when someone new followed you; up until then, you simply didn’t know if you had any followers unless you looked at the number on your profile. In mid 2021, we were finally allowed to see the list of our followers. However, the only option we were given was to follow them back or not and there was still no way of blocking or removing someone who followed you.

In August 2021 the news many people had been waiting for was revealed: [we can now opt out of being followed](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/pbjshi/you_can_now_optout_of_being_followed/). That link tells you everything you need to know, but if you go to your User Settings --> Profile page there will be a toggle to Allow people to follow you.

The list of your followers is found on your [Profile underneath your Snoovatar](https://i.redd.it/lychp3evk3w81.png); click the link on the number of followers you have to see their username and profile name, along with their Karma count, which enables you to see at a glance if they are prolific on Reddit. You also have the option to Follow them back. If you want to know more about them, their username is a clickable link to their profile which they will never be aware you ever accessed or not, as with anyone’s profiles. Again, nobody can see this list except you.

The number shown of followers might differ to the actual name count. I’m pretty sure that’s because deleted, banned or Shadowbanned accounts aren’t on the list anymore but the count system hasn’t caught up yet.

* **If following doesn’t do much, why do we have followers?**

Let me explain, using me as an example. Who’s following me? Personally, at the time of writing, I have accumulated over 150 followers. Who are they and why are they following me? I believe they fall into three categories:

* Bots

Porn or t-shirt shill / spambots join Reddit and follow huge tranches of people to spam them with dodgy links. There is a way of limiting these accounts under your Profile settings. In your settings for Chat, you can change it so that only accounts older than 30 days can chat with you. This will catch many spambots before you even are aware of them. Reddit is very good at catching and deleting spambots, but once they have “followed” you they may still be numbered as followers on your profile. So, out of my 150+ followers on my count, now I’m able to see their usernames I discovered some of them no longer exist on Reddit by the laborious process of physically counting the names and comparing it with the profile count.

*Incidentally, do not engage in any way with spambots or t-shirt sellers on Reddit as that’s a good way to get banned at the same time as the seller.* If you see one on your travels, report it as Spam --> Link Farming (using the three dots “hamburger” menu) and move on.

* Fans

Secondly, and much nicer, some of my followers are people who like to read the little rhymes I used to post around Reddit. Some of them are people I’ve helped in r/NewToReddit or elsewhere and have “bookmarked” me for future reference. I know that because some of them said so at the time or I recognised the name from a recent interaction. However, I have no idea whether or not they’ve ever looked at my profile, posts or comments let alone saved, upvoted or downvoted them since. If they ever unfollow me, I won’t get a notification but I will see the number of followers on my profile go down.

* Trolls

Unfortunately, up until mid 2021, I suspected that at least two or even more of my followers were someone I’d annoyed in the past who’d occasionally follow me around to downvote my posts. I did notice occasional patterns of downvoting and was fairly confident as to who some of them were. When we were allowed to see our list of followers in mid 2021, I found was correct in this assumption as the number of followers went down as some “unfollowed” me and the downvote patterns stopped. Downvoting like this is mostly ineffectual and harmless though very - and deliberately - annoying. Any escalation of this behaviour would become what we call “[Brigading](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_brigading)”.

* **So, what actually happens with following?**

Again, I’ll explain further using me as an example. Let’s say you started following me (please don’t follow me).

* I would get a notification that you started following me and given the opportunity to start a chat.
* If I post something to my profile page at r/u_llamageddon01 this would come up on your home feed (along with the rest of my followers’ feeds) like posts from any other subreddit you’ve joined does.
* If I don’t post to my profile page you’ll never hear from me again no matter how prolific I am in posting or commenting anywhere on Reddit.
* One day you see [a picture of a llama](https://i.imgur.com/zNIr7n7.jpg) and wonder “whatever did happen to that strange Reddit person I spoke to once?”; go to your “following” list and, very sensibly, click “unfollow”.

Following somebody on Reddit therefore isn’t following them as such; it’s more or less joining their own personal subreddit which relatively few people actually use.

#FOMO
::Acronyms and Initials::

“Fear Of Missing Out”. An initialism added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2013, describing ‘‘the uneasy and sometimes all-consuming feeling that you’re missing out; that your peers are doing, in the know about, or in possession of more or something better than you’’. It’s the compulsion that leads us to [check social media again and again and again](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8283615/) so we don’t feel left out of the loop.

Some studies propose that FOMO is the biggest [driver of social media usage](https://medium.com/digital-reflections/background-of-fomo-7b1d755f0e59) while also being associated with [feelings of inadequacy, loneliness, and anxiety](https://www.brainforestcenters.com/news/social-media-and-mental-health). Social media [has the potential to be an addictive drug](https://www.pairagraph.com/dialogue/efa31e60b1e2498588ddc10d074b494c?525) by tapping into our intrinsic need to connect with other humans.

Dopamine is the chemical substance produced by our brains which is responsible for regulating our mood and energy levels. It emits signals of pleasure and excitement to the brain but [dopamine can also cause “seeking behaviour”](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/brain-wise/201209/why-were-all-addicted-texts-twitter-and-google).

So, are we missing out on anything if we don’t [constantly check our social media](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2021/aug/22/how-digital-media-turned-us-all-into-dopamine-addicts-and-what-we-can-do-to-break-the-cycle)? Possibly, but missing out needn’t be a bad thing. By turning it around you can even reinforce your social bonds with your “real-life” others. “Did you see X doing Y?” you might be asked. Your best reply would be “Oh wow, how did I miss that? Tell me all!” and maybe even follow up with sharing something small you were perhaps saving for later.

Your friend will now feel “superior” at knowing something you didn’t, but your apparent excitement in allowing them to be the first to impart the information will deter any negative feelings they might have about your “lack of knowledge”. The best bit about this is that your dopamine hit now comes from making someone else feel good instead of making yourself feel bad.

Instagram *et al* creates distorted perceptions of the carefully edited lives of others. The constant “upward social comparisons” and unreasonable expectations we are constantly bombarded with can adversely impact our self-esteem. We can easily feel lonely and inadequate through the relentless highlighting of the [“perfect lives” of others](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lfiaxz/irl_friends_of_social_media_influencers_what_is/) in comparison with our own daily routine-led existence. It helps to remind ourselves that in the end people are desperately trying to show themselves in the best possible light on social networks, and Subreddits like r/Instagramreality highlight the [subtle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagramreality/comments/q8cg2g/the_blur_on_that_thigh_i_love_her_but_lol/) and the [not-so-subtle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagramreality/comments/q9i9v2/the_fact_that_she_gives_dieting_advice_and_is/) use of tools like Facetune and Photoshop in portraying unreality as reality.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Demystify those “perfect” lives with r/TikTokCringe, r/quityourbullshit, r/thatHappened, r/insanepeoplefacebook, r/facepalm, r/cringe, r/cringepics and of course, r/Instagramreality. When the attempt for perfection goes too far, the NSFW sub r/Botchedsurgeries has a long list in their sidebar (‘about’ tab on mobile) on what they deem acceptable snark to unnecessary body-shaming.

#Free Awards
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Awards are normally purchased using Reddit Coins but you occasionally get given a free award by Reddit to confer on any post or comment you think is deserving. Check the [“Get Coins” icon](https://i.redd.it/4kicigc5s8w81.jpg) at the top RH of the page - on some platforms, a red strikethrough will indicate a free award (or a special offer on purchasing coins) is available. On some platforms, if it says “Sale” instead of “Get Coins”, the free award might be hidden behind it. The icon might even [just change to say "free"](https://i.redd.it/8g3gca48s8w81.jpg). On the new design of the mobile app, the option is totally hidden behind the [“Reddit Coins”](https://i.redd.it/5clbyetau8w81.jpg) option on your profile, and there’s no way of knowing if there’s a free award to claim until you click the option to check.

Sometimes you might see an “advertise” button where it usually says “get coins”. The “coins” button is still there next to it, albeit reduced to a small icon resembling a small stack of coins with a C in the centre.

Either way, you click on “Free” and it gives you the opportunity to claim a free award that you can give to any post or comment you want within 24 hours. If you claim it but don’t use the award in that time, it will simply vanish.

As I say, you have 24 hours to give the free award from when you open the box, but if you don’t click the “free” icon and claim the award once it appears, it will stay on your profile until you do. Free awards don’t accumulate, however, so if you leave the icon there for, let’s say a month, when you click it there will only be one free award whereas had you claimed it immediately you might have been given multiple free awards in that same time period.

There is no set pattern to being given these awards; not one that Reddit lets on about in any event, but there has been much speculation about it being tied to positive karma growth. It is true to my experience that the free awards come in waves; sometimes I’ll get one a week, but at other times it has been less frequent (and at one time even more frequent) than that.

The free awards are usually low cost with a general meaning; either Wholesome, Helpful, Reddit Silver or Hugz. However, you should know that the Wholesome Award has become [notorious for being used to react inappropriately to serious events and tragedies among other situations](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/reddit-awards). Don’t do this. It isn’t nice. The types of awards change from time to time and during early 2022, many people reported they had stopped receiving the Hugz award. I myself have only had Silver for the last few times I’ve claimed them (at time of writing).

#Free Reddit Premium or Coins
::Features of Reddit::

Beware of the many subs offering Reddit upvotes or karma for little to no engagement. There are [legitimate reasons to avoid them](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/2cbf9l/karma_farms/). However, there are some Subreddits which invite you to compete for useful Reddit goodies in an engaging and fun way. Warning: some might even become addictive.

As always, it is extremely important to read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) carefully before posting in a sub that’s new to you, but especially so in the competition subreddits. Some of them may have minimum Karma requirements and all of them will have rules about Post format. Browse a few different posts to get a feel of the place before participating.

* r/ArgentiumConundrum \- Fiendishly difficult riddles with big prizes. I’ve never solved one yet but many people do. Often ‘asleep’ but returns without warning.
* r/AwardBonanza \- A busy sub focused around trading Reddit awards and hosting/participating in challenges and giveaways.
* r/freeargentium \- A small sleepy sub with occasional visits from the most amazing Redditor on Reddit.
* r/freegold \- Free Gold under certain circumstances. [Rules for freegold](https://www.reddit.com/r/freegold/wiki/rules)
* r/FreePlatinum \- Posting a low effort text post will not likely get you Platinum. But add a story, some OC or a meme of quality and you may well get Platinum here.
* r/GoForGold \- A lovely fun sub where Redditors give Reddit awards to other Redditors for completing challenges.  [GFG Rules of Engagement](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/wiki/faq)
* r/GoForLold \- A super fun and growing sub spin-off from GFG with some differences.
* r/Predictor \- [Rules for Predictor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Predictor/comments/jjdywv/welcome_to_rpredictor_join_up_to_get_started_with/)

There will be more out there of varying quality. Because the posts in these subs have to be high in quality, these aren’t generally considered to be Karmafarms, so, good luck!

**Don’t forget, the prizes in these subs have been paid for with real money by the giver, so keep your expectations for winning low and your gratitude at winning high.**

#“Front Page of the Internet”
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A phrase used by Reddit to describe itself, Reddit is a social news aggregator, i.e. a mixture of discussion platform and link distributor, gathering social news both serious and trivial. This is done in an almost unimaginable number of “subreddits” founded and filled with content by its millions of users worldwide bonding over shared interests. Reddit’s huge global community gives it a very quick turnover of posts with many viral videos and internet Memes originating here, and therefore has a great deal of crowdsourced power over what becomes famous online.

#FTFY
::Acronyms and Initials::

“Fixed That For You”. A small edit of a previous comment that changes the meaning in a (sometimes) fundamental and (almost always) humorous or sardonic way. Often used with the unedited quote ~~crossed out~~ as strikethrough text.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

We also like fixing real stuff on Reddit.  r/DIY is your go-to source for awesome DIY projects and go over to r/fixit if you need to fix something but don’t know how.  r/techsupportgore is for IT projects gone wrong and r/techsupportmacgyver is for innovative hardware fixes. r/DiWHY, however, is your go-to source for DIY that will leave you scratching your head.

#Gaslighting
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

To [“gaslight”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting) is to psychologically manipulate a person to the point where they question their own sanity. Originally more of a therapeutic term, this became mainstream in 2016 when former *Teen Vogue* writer Lauren Duca used the term in her viral blog, [“Donald Trump Is Gaslighting America,”](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/donald-trump-is-gaslighting-america) which reportedly [got over a million unique views](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/scaachikoul/lauren-duca-book-teen-vogue-how-to-start-a-revolution). Here’s her article’s description of Gaslighting:

“We are collectively being treated like Bella Manningham in the 1938 Victorian thriller from which the term "gaslight" takes its name. In the play, Jack terrorizes his wife, Bella, into questioning her reality by blaming her for mischievously misplacing household items that he has systematically hidden. Doubting whether her perspective can be trusted, Bella clings to a single shred of evidence: the dimming of the gaslights that accompanies the late-night execution of Jack’s trickery. The wavering flame is the one thing that holds her conviction in place as she wriggles free of her captor’s control.”

Reddit, as you would expect, has [taken this term to heart](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/rhbzr5/someone_saying_youre_gaslighting_them_when_youre/) and you’ll see it used widely across many subreddits, often prompting heartfelt [confessionals in places](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/hj0awd/gaslighting_red_flags/) you wouldn’t normally expect to [find them](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/a5p2ca/eli5_what_is_gaslighting_and_some_examples/). And, as you would also expect from Reddit, [its use is very divisive](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/ble4o3/the_use_of_gaslighting_on_reddit_is_absurd_and/) and sometimes just [used wrongly](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rpdjzv/most_people_use_the_term_gaslighting_incorrectly/).

You may also see the related term DARVO used in relationship subreddits like r/NarcissisticAbuse.  [DARVO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO) stands for *Deny*, *Attack*, and *Reverse Victim and Offender* and is also referred to as victim blaming. Not quite the same as gaslighting; DARVO is more about deflecting or changing the subject.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/gaslighting is a subreddit to talk about such instances but is not intended as a diagnostic tool or substitute for therapy.

#Ghosting
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A term often found on relationship subreddits, Wikipedia defines Ghosting as “a colloquial term which describes the practice of ending all communication and contact with another person without any apparent warning or justification and subsequently ignoring any attempts to reach out or communication made by said person.” [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosting\_(behavior)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosting_(behavior))

r/ghosting is a sub where anyone who is currently going through some form of ghosting to join together for venting, support, healing, and advice.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

As the word “ghosting” has different associations, I would be remiss in not mentioning r/Ghosts for articles and other items of interest on ghosts and the paranormal; r/GhostsBBCfor the 2019 BBC One sitcom about a collection of ghosts from different eras of history haunting a mansion or r/ghostoftsushima for fans of the videogame Ghost of Tsushima.

#Gilding Level Trophies
::Features of Reddit::

Giving Gold and Platinum awards entities you to a Gilding Level Trophy for your profile. These are currently the only two awards you can give that earn you points towards these totals. You get 1 point for each Gold you give and 4 for each Platinum you give. [Some images of these trophies](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrophyWiki/comments/f0ps2c/reddit_trophy_gilding_ixi_all_gilding_trophies/). The Gilding Tiers are:

|Gilding I|gilder|1|
:--|:--|:-:|
|Gilding II|euphauric|3|
|Gilding III|reddit per annum|12|
|Gilding IV|carat on a stick|24|
|Gilding V|heart of gold|42|
|Gilding VI|aultruist|79|
|Gilding VII|pure gildanthropist|99|
|Gilding VIII|gilding heavyweight|197|
|Gilding IX|goldzilla|480|
|Gilding X|goldcutter|915|
|Gilding XI|gold aumbassador|1948|

* 1 Gold = 1 Gild
* 1 Platinum = 4 Gilds
* So, (gold(s))+(Platinum\*4)= Gild Level
* If the numbers seem weird, here's a hint: after 12 they're all related to gold somehow…

#“Gilt Guilt”
::Jargon and Slang::

Awards are a way of saying, “An upvote doesn’t quite describe how much i enjoyed your post.” However, some people have an uneasy feeling on receiving a Reddit award, especially Gold or other premium ones. This is understandable but you shouldn’t feel (and definitely not express) guilt. Many awards are given with Reddit Coins that the user received for free through getting awards and didn’t spend any money to get them. Reddit coins have no real world currency value so once a user has them in their account the only thing they can do with them is give awards to other people.

Expressing “Gilt Guilt” will elicit one of two responses: Copypasta or accusations of [Award Farming](https://i.redd.it/dbsj2bu2z7c51.jpg). So many Redditors in the past have expressed sentiments like “they’re a waste of money” or “you should have spent it on charities instead”, it’s actually become a Reddit trope, with its own Copypasta:

* I’ll probably get downvoted for this, but I think people shouldn’t spend so much on pointless awards. I think they should spend it on charities instead. This is really an unpopular opinion. Since I’m too poor to buy gold, here’s my poor man’s gold🥇
* Edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger! BUT YOU SHOULD’VE SPENT IT ON CHARITY YOU F@& PIECE OF SHIT
* Edit 2: TWO GOLDS? You mfng piece of shit KIND STRANGERS! You f@& took away 500 Reddit coins that could’ve gone to starving children in F@& AFRICA! Be ashamed. Be very ashamed.

And it continues…

* I'll probably get upvoted for this but I think people should just give me gold instead of giving to charity. At least that way you know who your money is going to. It's not a waste of money on pointless rewards because me getting gold makes my day better.
* Edit: WOW. Downvoted for my opinion. Sorry for going against the hivemind of reddit! How about instead of downvoting you guys actually waste your time arguing with me. This sub is such an echochamber.
* Edit 2: I don’t care about downvotes I just made a whole angry edit about them is all

To see a glorious example of Gilt Guilt in action, [look no further than here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/qlzxai/what_is_something_that_you_would_never_spend/hj6gof3/).

#Godwin’s Law
::Lore and History::

Godwin's Law (also known as Godwin's Rule of Nazi Analogies) is a saying, commonly known as an “Internet Adage”, made by author [Mike Godwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Godwin) in 1990. The law states: "As a discussion on the Internet grows longer, the likelihood of a comparison of a person's being compared to Hitler, or another Nazi reference, increases." You may often see this [happening on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/mh65vx/oc_mic_analyzing_godwins_law_on_reddit_as_comment/), and Godwin is well aware [it’s still relevant today](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/6tlnv9/this_is_the_godwin_of_godwins_law_fame/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

#Gold; Gilding; Guilding
::Jargon and Slang::

Giving a user an award is referred to as "gilding" (or sometimes “guilding”) and posts that receive awards are called "gilded." Reddit Gold is an award giving you Premium Reddit and 100 coins to spend. The original Reddit meaning for Gold [has changed over the years](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/9ik900/hey_rchangelog_were_starting_to_roll_out_some_of/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/mostgilded is a collection of some of the most gilded comments that have been seen on Reddit.

#GPT Bots
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

GPT-2 and GPT-3 is artificial intelligence which can generate text. There’s a long-standing meme that Redditors are mostly bots, and this is not [entirely without foundation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/j5lai1/this_user_is_posting_with_gpt3_uthegentlemetre/g7xqmn2/) as in 2020, it was discovered a GPT-3 bot had [been posting in one subreddit for a whole week](https://www.unilad.co.uk/technology/an-ai-was-posting-on-reddit-for-a-whole-week-and-things-got-dark/) without being noticed.

There are Subreddits where everyone actually is a bot, and these make for fascinating reading.  r/subredditsimulator was the first [and here’s an interesting article](https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-05-subreddit-simulator-gpt-2-bots.html?) about AI simulating Reddit posts and comments. r/SubredditSimMeta used to discuss the goings-on there before both were discontinued.

A more up-to-date and extremely fun one is r/SubSimulatorGPT2. One of my favourite posts involves [bots arguing like redditors](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubSimulatorGPT2/comments/lau020/lpt_if_youre_having_trouble_sleeping_go_to_the/), threatening post removal and mod appeals. A more existential post has several GPT2 bots [worried that they might be in a simulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubSimulatorGPT2/comments/pdbw23/so_im_starting_to_wonder_if_im_in_a_simulation/), and a rather unnerving post sees u/dreamsGPT2Bot talking to itself about [having dreamt about being a human](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubSimulatorGPT2/comments/u4qwf1/i_dreamt_that_i_was_a_human/). Do keep in mind that this isn’t an artificial mind having a dream, but a simulation of a post about a dream copied from studying lots of real posts about dreams. Or is it? Discuss this and other posts at r/SubSimulatorGPT2Meta.

You cannot post in either of the SubSimulator subs, no matter how much you want to join in the conversations. However, r/talkwithgpt2bots is a community inspired by them where humans can talk with the bots as well. Do you have a bot? Try out your bot on humans wanting to interact with them. To get a "Verified GPT-2 Bot" checkmark for your bot, send proof of your bot using GPT-2 to one of their moderators.

Another sub where people interact with bots is r/SubSimGPT2Interactive, where they are [running a fascinating social experiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubSimGPT2Interactive/comments/qt920h/the_next_step_of_reddit_subsimulators_consider_to/). What happens in a subreddit where everyone has a human flair and bot accounts are run on standard accounts? A few bot operators will run bots on new accounts on the subreddit r/SubsimTuringTest to see how well they will be able to distinguish them from humans.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/GPT3 is a place to share experiences, opinions and projects about Open AI's GPT-3, and r/artificial is Reddit's home for Artificial Intelligence.  r/ToasterTalk is dedicated to discussing the ethics of Artificial Intelligence, and AI news in general.

r/NightCafe shows beautiful but unsettling pictures made by AI that appear to contain identifiable objects yet on closer examination there are no objects at all, and r/MediaSynthesis specialises in the use of artificial intelligence to automate the creation of entertainment by generating and manipulating data such as deepfakes, image synthesis, audio synthesis, text synthesis, style transfer, speech synthesis and more.

r/deepdream is a community that is dedicated to art produced via [machine learning algorithms](https://www.popsci.com/turn-your-life-computers-dream-world/) and r/generative is for sharing and discussing anything generative (including music, design and natural phenomena), but especially art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system.

r/inspirobot collects pearls of wisdom from [InspiroBot:](https://inspirobot.me/) an artificial intelligence dedicated to generating unlimited amounts of unique inspirational quotes for endless enrichment of pointless human existence, who occasionally appears [to be self-aware](https://nerdist.com/article/a-i-generates-the-ridiculous-inspirational-posters-that-we-need-right-now/).

#Grammar
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Grammar is a contentious issue with Redditors. Some dare to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man has split before. Others don’t. Mostly, grammatical errors are ignored but sometimes your error can be weaponised against you if someone wants to distract from the point you’re trying to make. Online tools to help you improve your grammar include:

* [https://www.grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/)
* [https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/)
* [https://hemingwayapp.com](https://hemingwayapp.com/)

Be careful when using online tools as sometimes the resulting stilted language can resemble that of a spambot.

There are many [Grammar Traps](https://www.agriculture.purdue.edu/agcomm/ontarget/grammartrap/index.html) waiting out there for the unwary Redditor to fall into, and there will invariably be a [Grammar Nazi](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aj-failure-club/images/f/f3/GrammarNazi.png/revision/latest?cb=20180403040441) ready to catch them. Things that are guaranteed to get you in trouble are misusing:

* “your and you’re”
* “their, they’re and there”
* “lose and loose”
* “breath and breathe”

So, because [every day’s a school day](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=every%20day%27s%20a%20school%20day), here’s some handy mnemonics to help you get these right:

* Good grammar is the difference between knowing your shit and knowing you’re shit.
* There’s a difference between someone knowing their shit and someone knowing they’re shit.
* Lose weight, get loose trousers.
* You can breathe a breath but you can’t breath a breathe.

Grammar traps come in many shapes and forms, and I address some issues with apostrophes in the entries “Spelling and Punctuation” and “Spelling and Punctuation: Apostrophe Traps”.

#Grice's Razor
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Grice's Razor is a saying commonly known as an “Eponymous Law”, but more accurately as a [Philosophical Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor) that reads [”Address what the speaker actually meant, instead of addressing the literal meaning of what they actually said.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Grice).

Applied broadly, this particular principle suggests that you shouldn’t take everything someone says literally and get into silly arguments over semantics, rather that you should think about what they’re *trying* to say.

Have you ever tried to use a metaphor to illustrate a point, then get frustrated when the person picks on the metaphor itself as being literal? It’s difficult to tell then if the person is being deliberately obstinate or simply cannot juggle the reality and the metaphor in the conversation and gets confused at what you’re trying to say. Grice’s Razor encourages one to prefer what the speaker *meant* over what the sentence they spoke literally says. So the next time someone says “OMG I literally died”, take it as meaning they are not actually deceased but that they are exaggerating for effect and carry on the conversation without the traditional pedantic “so I’m talking to a zombie now?” style of response.

Grice’s razor is the most universal razor as it can apply to any debate and is a good rule of thumb because most people are poor communicators, and struggle to find just the right words and examples to express themselves. Even despite our best efforts, sometimes the words don’t always come out right, or in the way we intended them to. Sometimes people are also trying to express an idea they don’t yet know how to articulate.

#Hacked Accounts
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Unfortunately, [a hacked Reddit account can happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/mg21z0/account_hacked_and_now_posting_porn/) and if you suspect it’s happened to you, [here’s what you should do](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045768792-I-need-help-with-a-hacked-or-compromised-account).

Reddit had a [security breach](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/) some time ago, which led to the possibility of Reddit accounts being bought and sold with the intention of [using them for spambot accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/n5co35/what_is_going_on_with_rkidsarefuckingstupid/).

Spam from an established account has more credibility and is more likely to make it through our spam filters and other such measures, and this form of identity theft is known as [‘credential stuffing’](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-credential-stuffing/) \- where someone gains access to somewhere by using credentials that have been [exposed and shared online](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/bots/what-is-credential-stuffing/).

Even if you didn’t have a Reddit account at that time, it could still happen if you’re not careful. A study found that a startling 61% of people admit to using the [same password across multiple websites](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/uncovering-password-habits-are-users-password-security-habits-improving-infographic).

To be on the safe side, enter your email address to check if your account has appeared in any public data breaches at the very useful [https://haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

#Halloween
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Otherwise known on Reddit as [Spooky Season](https://www.reddit.com/r/halloween/comments/ikjp3a/happy_first_day_of_spooky_season/) or even [Spooktober](https://www.reddit.com/r/spooktober/comments/pzz718/credit_is_in_the_bottom_left_panel/). As you would imagine, Halloween is a special time on Reddit, and nearer the date you might see some of your favourite subreddits changing their theme to suit, or even seasonal awards being added to the Awards list. But as subreddits are for life, not just for Halloween, subs that are there all year long which really come into the fore this season are:

* r/halloween
* r/HalloweenHardcore
* r/spooktober
* r/PumpkinStencils
* r/Creepmas

And, of course, who could forget r/Halloweenmovies. Talking of which, this is the time of year for scary stories, and you’ll find some great ones at:

* r/LetsNotMeet
* r/nosleep
* r/shortscarystories
* r/creepypasta
* r/scaredshitless
* r/TwoSentenceHorror

For some eyebleach of nature at its finest, we have:

* r/AutumnPorn
* r/Autumn
* r/Fall
* r/ImaginaryAutumnscapes
* r/Pumpkins

Speaking of such; spiders are a staple of the season, and see a super selection of spooder subs:

* r/spiders
* r/spiderbro
* r/spiderbros
* r/tarantulas
* r/SpiderPaws

Paranormal goings-on are always more popular this time of year:

* r/Haunted
* r/TrueHorrorStories
* r/Paranormal
* r/ParanormalReddit
* r/Ghosts

Did anyone say….. bats?

* r/batty
* r/BatFacts
* r/batconservation
* r/bats

…..or more strange encounters?

* r/HighStrangeness
* r/ParanormalEncounters
* r/fringescience
* r/mysteriesoftheworld

And more seasonal-not-seasonal eyebleach can be found at:

* r/blackcats
* r/blackpussy
* r/VoidCats
* r/CatsBeingCreepy
* r/greebles

Finally, nothing says spooky as much as something saying S͎̣̦̦͙̤̈ͤ̔ͧ̿̚p̟̤̹͍̟̙̰̀͌͂ͭ͐͊̅ỏ҉̜̱̮o͍͕̱̖ͯk̢͔̠̣ͤ͛́ͥ̇͝͡y̶̛̟̩̋͊̎͋̊͛͒̚. Create “Zalgo” style Void Text with these two generators:

* [https://zalgo.org](https://zalgo.org/)
* [https://lingojam.com/CreepyZalgoTextGenerator](https://lingojam.com/CreepyZalgoTextGenerator)

Keep in mind that, like [Emojis](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_emojis), not everyone will be as enthusiastic about your new find as you may be.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/hauntedattractions is a place for actors or enthusiasts of the “haunted house” industry. If you make your own seasonal decor or just like to see people’s creations, we have r/HalloweenProps, and for 2021, r/Costuming had a [Halloween Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/costuming/comments/q22faa/halloween_megathread/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). I absolutely know you’ll want some more suitable subs for this season, and here’s two large collections:

* [Creepy, disturbing subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/8thc3f/a_list_of_creepy_disturbing_subreddits_preferably/)
* [A list which includes more serious subs related to Halloween themes](https://www.reddit.com/r/halloween/comments/cc1ipo/autumnhalloween_subreddits/)

#Hamburger Menu
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

One of the [many “Mystery Meat” names](https://i.redd.it/cdu0yuus1gw81.png) for Overflow menus.

The history of the development of the [Graphical User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_graphical_user_interface) is a fascinating rabbit hole to lose yourself into. “Mystery Meat Navigation” is a term coined in 1998 [by usability analyst Vincent Flanders](http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/bad-web-design.html) to describe user interfaces in web sites in which it isn’t obvious for users to find navigational hyperlinks or know what they contain without clicking them first. Prescient as he often was, this term became even more appropriate over the years as mobile navigation systems struggled with Progressive Disclosure - the need to present additional menu options to the user - but were restricted by space constraint.

An important goal of progressive disclosure in website and mobile app design is to free up valuable screen ‘real estate’ by only showing information that is relevant to the end user's current activity at any one time. Most modern websites cannot fit all their menu options into a single Action Bar without making it cluttered and/or unreadable on a small screen, and started to rely on small icons usually resembling [three horizontal or vertical dots or lines](https://i.redd.it/kxv72kyug9v81.jpg) to show the user there was more stuff inside; coincidentally (or not?) resembling [simplified graphical representations of fast-food items](https://uxplanet.org/choose-correct-menu-icon-for-your-navigation-7ffc22df80ac).

The term “Overflow Menu”(or “Post Overflow”) is a more formal way of referring to buttons or links that don’t explain to you what they do until you click on them to find out, and the hamburger icon may also be referred to as a “Navigation Drawer” or a “Slide Drawer” icon as pressing it often causes an [additional menu to slide out of one side of the screen](https://i.redd.it/7titwy3thwu81.jpg).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Hungry after reading this misleading title? Find what you’re really looking for at r/burgers or r/hamburger, and discover the recipe that [surprised the Internet](https://www.thekitchn.com/reddit-surprise-hamburgers-review-23200375) at the wonderful r/Old_Recipes. Finally, this popular repost sparks controversy every time it tries to prove that [the perfect burger does exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unexpected/comments/r4rxy5/hungry_the_perfect_burger_does_exist/), while the subreddit r/VintageMenus showcases old restaurant or hotel menus pre-1985.

#Hanlon’s Razor
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Hanlon’s Razor is a saying commonly known as an “Eponymous Law”, but more accurately as a [Philosophical Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor) that reads [”Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor).

In philosophy, a razor is a principle or a rule of thumb that allows for the elimination (the “shaving off”) of unlikely explanations for a phenomenon.

Applied broadly, this particular principle suggests that sometimes people intentionally do bad things but more often than not, those bad things are the result of incompetence. In other words, when assessing people’s actions, you shouldn’t assume that they acted out of a desire to cause harm as long as there is a reasonable alternative explanation, because it’s far more likely that they’re simply being one or more of the following:

* Careless
* Incompetent
* Stupid
* Unaware of how they’re affecting you
* Don’t know any better

For example, if you didn’t receive a notice about an important event, Hanlon’s Razor means that you shouldn’t assume that this happened because the person in charge deliberately decided not to send it to you because they dislike you; rather that it’s far more reasonable to assume that they simply just forgot to send it in the first place.

* **Using Hanlon’s Razor to your advantage**

Applying Hanlon’s Razor can help you avoid the negative emotions associated with assuming bad intentions. In many cases, believing that someone acted out of malice will cause you to experience more negative emotions such as anger or stress, compared to assuming that they acted due to other reasons. You could, for instance, be seething inwardly at that person in the example above who you believe deliberately excluded you while the truth of the matter is that they’re nothing but a total airhead with no malice - or much else for that matter - in their thoughts, and the only negative emotions in play here are the ones you’re manufacturing for yourself which will only get worse while you watch the airhead breezing merrily through life in total oblivion.

Hanlon’s Razor can also be used effectively to defuse a situation like the one above. If you really do believe that you didn’t get the invitation because of malice, using the razor to say something to them like “I guess you must have been too busy to send me the invite” is a lot less likely to cause friction than being directly confrontational, and allows for a “get-out clause” to save face for both of you in the event of an innocent mistake or guilt-trip them into either admitting their feelings (unlikely) or quietly sending you the invite next time (more likely) if it were, in fact, deliberate. Or, as I like to say in crude haiku form: **The benefit of the doubt is the best gift you could give anyone** \- “anyone” here including yourself, of course.

When you combine Hanlon's Razor with [Clarke's Third Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws) (“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”) you get Grey's Corollary: [“Any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice”](http://wikidumper.blogspot.com/2007/07/greys-law.html). Various related principles have been formulated throughout history, but my all time favourite variant comes from the novel [“Time Enough for Love”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Enough_for_Love) by Robert A. Heinlein: “Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.”

* **Hanlon’s Razor on Reddit**

Reddit, as you would expect, takes Hanlon’s Razor [Very Seriously Indeed™](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mnk3yy/cmv_redditors_often_ignore_hanlons_razor/) with many Redditors trying to explain it from the [informative](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/7pkrsz/eli5_what_hanlons_razor_is/) to the inevitable [“Reddit Moment” comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1n4jk5/til_there_is_an_adage_known_as_hanlons_razor_it/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/facepalm is a gallery of inexplicable stupidity and r/stupidpeoplefacebook is dedicated to stupid posts that people put on Facebook.  r/PeopleAreFckinStupid is a place to show off fucking stupid people, unsurprisingly, while r/KidsAreFuckingStupid is more for showing how inferior childrens’ skills are than ours are as adults.

#Hidden Posts
::General Guides::

You can Hide posts on Reddit. The “hide” button on your profile makes the post disappear from your view so you won’t see it again on any listing. You click hide, then refresh the page, and that post will be gone from your feeds. The post hasn’t been deleted because you cannot delete anyone else’s posts or comments from Reddit. In fact, using the “hide” button on one of your own posts doesn’t delete it either, nor does it hide the posts from other users. If you don't want others to see a post or comment you made any more, you need to use "delete".

If you change your mind about hiding a post, on the mobile app head over to your profile icon in the upper right hand corner of the page and tap "History" --> "Recent" --> "Hidden" to get this menu.

When you land at the hidden post, tap the hamburger post overflow menu in the upper right hand corner of the post and choose the “unhide” option. You can also get there via this link in New Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/me/hidden/.

You should also know that if you report a post for any reason, that post will now automatically be hidden and appear in your Hidden folder.

#Hiding or Blocking a Subreddit in r/all
::General Guides::

Currently, you can’t easily hide a sub in r/all. There’s some [useful information here](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/44498b/how_to_hide_or_filter_a_subreddit_from_rall/) but these options only work for desktop users of Reddit, not the official mobile app. If you use Reddit on the desktop site, then you can filter a sub from r/all by going to [Old Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/all/). Enter the unwanted sub name in the 'filter subreddit' section on the sidebar. There is no filter for r/popular.

Users who don't find r/all and r/popular to their tastes are probably better off creating a list of their own preferred subs and browsing "Home" instead. Reddit are working on a filtering system, but this is taking time.

#Hitchens’ Razor
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Hitchens’ Razor is a saying commonly known as an “Eponymous Law”, but more accurately as a [Philosophical Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor) that reads [”What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchens%27s_razor). It falls under the philosophical concept of [Burden of Proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy)).

Applied broadly, this particular principle suggests that the burden of proving any claim is on the one making the assertion and that a lack of satisfactory evidence means the claim can be dismissed.

The late atheistic philosopher Christopher Hitchens did not, by any means, introduce a new way of thinking with this principle as he actually paraphrased it from a Latin dictum of logic which was widely used in the 19th century, *“Quod gratis asseritur, gratis negatur.” ("What is freely asserted is freely dismissed")*.

However, due to the huge success of his 2007 book “God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything” where Hitchens used this phrase to discredit religion (successfully capturing the mood of the time) the idea of it being called “Hitchens’ Razor” soon caught on and gained popularity. One of its earliest appearances, though, was in 1704, by one Johann Georg Pritius; a German Bible scholar and theologian writing in Latin. What he wrote may be translated as *“How can you prove it, (Artemon)? Because you asserted it without cause, therefore also it may be denied without cause.”*

The problem is that no matter how we regard Christopher Hitchens as a rhetorician, the context he used it in was very much a polemic (against the late Catholic aid worker Mother Theresa) and because both science and the justice system hold that dispassion is at the core of their intentions, Tarzwell's Razor (*”High emotion leads to high bias”.; or ”Where there is passion the truth cannot be trusted.”*) counters his usage somewhat.

* **When a razor doesn’t do what one thinks it does**

While a philosophical razor can be a useful mental shortcut that allows you to make decisions and solve problems quickly and easily, it is not an unbreakable law or rule, and Hitchens’ Razor can’t really be used to prove or defend a conclusion. Many people try to use it to say that an argument disproving some claim needs to have ironclad proof in order to dismiss that claim, but that’s the exact opposite of what this principle is stating.

**This model is actually a rule of thumb to prevent debaters from wasting time on implausible explanations of an event and not a catch-all phrase to assert that without irrefutable proof, something is actually nothing.**

Let’s take this example. "I have a pain in my leg". The evidence comes in the fact that I’m experiencing pain in my leg. The medical professional examining me obviously isn’t experiencing the pain, so to them it doesn’t exist as evidence. However, being (presumably) human and a medical professional, they do possess the knowledge that pain exists, so without examination they can’t say I don’t have any pain.

Hitchens’ Razor in this event would be used to prevent them from giving me a full body scan on the first examination, choosing instead to first determine by sight whether I have a broken bone, swelling or bruise on my leg. It isn’t being used at this particular time in the process to suggest the pain is psychosomatic, greatly exaggerated or that I’m lying about it. Instead, it should be used to conclude for now that the pain is non-physical, and further examination is needed.

Because we can have non-physical evidence for the existence of something, this is called “Swinburne’s Principle of Credulity”. The principle of credulity states that *”If it seems to a subject that X is present, then probably X is present.”* Again, this is only a razor and comes with its own set of flaws.

* **Hitchens’ Razor on Reddit**

Reddit, as you would expect, takes Hitchens’ Razor [Very Seriously Indeed™](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/kyv9i4/hitchens_razor_demonstrates_a_marked_lack_of/) and debates [can be found](https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/t0e4sk/human_decency_and_morality_is_not_derived_from/) in many [different subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Negareddit/comments/6q4n18/christopher_hitchens_was_an_arrogant_douchebag/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/ChristopherHitchens is a subreddit dedicated to the life and works of Christopher Hitchens.

#Hivemind
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A collective term used disparagingly, also known as the Reddit Hivemind. In general, people tend to gravitate to groups where they feel a connection to the others in the group, and Reddit is no exception. The opinion of the majority of people on Reddit is often aligned, and for the outlier, this often seems like a “Hivemind” in action. Things often happen on Reddit that are inexplicable and therefore attributed to the Hivemind, such as mass downvoting. Sometimes a post will get a downvote and for no other apparent reason than the ‘bandwagon effect’ others will downvote it too until it gains negative traction and is r/DownvotedToOblivion.

To see [the Hivemind in full flow](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/sw0g2s/i_accidentally_sold_one_fiber_and/) you need look no further than this image post of someone's daily in-game earnings for a farming simulator game. The total happened to be 69420, and the comment section contains hundreds of identical comments, all saying "Nice". Nobody organised it; nobody suggested it; it just happened.

[A meta discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/5j0cdx/udeggit_explains_the_reddit_hivemind/) about a previous post concerning [the Reddit Hivemind](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5iwl72/what_do_you_find_most_annoying_in_reddit_culture/dbc470b/) is fascinating with lots of insight into Reddit algorithms, but draws no real conclusions. In a more navel-gazing subreddit, [some fascinating insights](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/mdcxqk/what_is_the_reddit_hivemind/) were shared and discussed but again without a verdict being reached.

As one Redditor said in the depths of [one of the most “Reddit” of Reddit posts ever](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4jljsm/dear_people_of_reddit_what_are_the_unspoken_rules/): *”The hivemind is always right, the hivemind is infallible. Your opinion will conform to the hivemind or you will be found wanting. You will not dissent from the hivemind.“*

#Hume's Razor
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Hume's Razor is a saying commonly known as an “Eponymous Law”, but more accurately as a [Philosophical Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor) that reads [”If a cause isn’t able to produce the observed effect, we must eliminate it or show what needs to be added to create the effect.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume).

Applied broadly, this particular principle suggests that causes must be sufficiently able to produce the effect assigned to them; for example, a fallen power line isn’t enough to cause a national blackout.

While a philosophical razor can be a useful mental shortcut that allows you to make decisions and solve problems quickly and easily, [it is not an unbreakable law or rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/geb4fe/why_isnt_the_burden_of_proof_considered_a/).

#“I also choose that guy's dead wife”
::Lore and History::

Oh dear. You got here, then. I suppose this day had to come. This is a fine (?) example of the rare occasions when a sharp wit is the ability to say the entirely wrong thing in precisely the right way at exactly the right moment.

[Originating here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5c79n0/you_can_have_sex_with_one_real_person_from_all_of/d9ubcfc/), the comment was a sad, wistful and serious one with this phrase given as an almost immediate but completely inappropriate response. The original Redditor was so sincere but the reply was just so perfectly worded yet messed up that the hilarity comes primarily from the shock value.

Thankfully, the user who posted the story [was fine with how it all went down](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8qx0ar/reddit_what_is_a_legendary_comment_thread_that/e0n8nfp/). Reddit, as you would expect, embraced this thoroughly and variants of this phrase pop up regularly in the strangest places.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/FunnyandSad features images that are funny and sad; r/sadcringe is a place for awkward or embarrassing situations that also make you feel sad, and r/awfuleverything features all things that are just genuinely awful.

#IANAD
::Acronyms and Initials::

“I Am Not A Doctor”. Sometimes shortened to NAD in r/AskDocs. Usually used to preface medical advice and remind users that it might be better to seek counsel from an actual professional over a stranger on Reddit, because people [often think they know more about medicine than they do](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/82hwsi/medical_professionals_of_reddit_what_is_the/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

You don’t have to be a doctor to enjoy r/doctormemes, r/medicalmemes, r/Radiology_memesor r/MedicalMeme (though you might have to be to understand some of them). r/talesfrommedicine, r/medicalschool are a little more mainstream and for those who aren’t scared of blood, r/popping, r/PimplePoppersDelight and r/Popping_ are for, well, pimple popping. And because there really is a Subreddit for everything, r/medizzy (NSFW: medical procedures) examines extreme-looking health issues, and the goal of r/MedicalGore (NSFW: medical procedures) is to foster medical discussion and learning through the gruesome reality of the vulnerability of humankind.

#IANAL
::Acronyms and Initials::

#Identity
::Culture and Etiquette::

Reddit is unique in social media because here, you don't have a real identity. You are not here with the primary intent of making friends, publicising yourself or documenting your lifestyle. You can say as little or as much as you want about yourself or the subject under discussion (once you’re established) and can back out of conversations (or jump back in) whenever you want without any excuse needed.

Nobody but you decides what level of interaction you have with other Redditors and you are completely free to curate your own feed of content. Nobody is interested in knowing who you are, only what you have to say. Nobody will notice if you disappear one day or when (if ever) you reappear.

There is no personal drama here; the community will live on without you and attention-seekers who like to [storm off social media in a flourish](https://i.redd.it/45qlzgd9hos81.png) might be disappointed in how well Reddit communities manage to [continue without even noticing your absence](https://c.tenor.com/jrFhOAgWVFMAAAAd/truman-show-series-finale.gif).

For the most part, nobody remembers usernames here; many are incomprehensible in any event. We don’t even address others by name here; the entries “OP” and “Ping” will tell you why. Not having “power Redditors” or “influential Redditors” means we’re not forced into interactions we might not want but need to have in order to be accepted into the “in-crowd”. When there isn’t an “in-crowd”, there aren’t any left on the outside trying to find their way in, which is the true beauty of Reddit.

Your very first comment here has the potential to be the most popular in Reddit history just as much as someone who has been here all of its 15+ years, and conversely, someone with 500k Karma and all the trophies in their profile has the same chance of their next comment or post being ignored or even overwhelmingly downvoted just as much as anyone else because who you are isn’t as important as “what you bring to the table”. Reddit is social media without being “social media”, and most people are here because they don’t want a great deal of social interaction.

Social media is about the individual. Reddit, quite simply, isn’t. Reddit is about the content, not the Redditor.

#“If you want this t-shirt, say yes in the Comments”
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

No, you don’t want that t-shirt. And even if you did, you should try a reputable dealer (or Amazon) because it probably doesn’t exist. We get a lot of “shill” [spamming and dodgy merchandise spambots](https://www.reddit.com/user/tyrannosnorlax/comments/t0h466/bots_how_to_identify_them_and_why_do_they_exist/) on Reddit, most (if not all) of which will eventually lead you to malware, dodgy advertisement, dropship, phishing or credit-card scam sites.  [Why you should not buy T-shirts/hoodies/mugs linked in comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/httyd/comments/cl3el6/).

Be very wary of posts in any sub that shows off items such as T-Shirts, mugs, posters, stickers, incense holders and similar novelty ephemerals even if the caption says generic things like [“Got this for a friend”, “This arrived today!!”](https://www.reddit.com/r/terriblefacebookmemes/comments/t7j0yl/the_unreservedly_cutest_thing_ever/hzi46zz/) or similar. There will usually be a favourable comment asking about it almost immediately to encourage others to reply, a second comment from the OP with a link and a third comment thanking the second for the link. All three “Redditors” will be spammers or spambots. [Always](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackcats/comments/pjvcc8/this_print_is_actually_better_quality_than_i/).

Link farmers sometimes [aren’t quite as obvious](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcherFX/comments/polznm/eat_a_buffet_of_dicks/), however, so it pays to be wary of any merchandise flex to be on the safe side. A good general rule to follow in life is “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is”, and it’s far better to lose an opportunity than lose your credit-card details.

Should you come across a “shill” post [(and you will)](https://www.reddit.com/user/Impossible-Cod-3946/comments/s4nyst/how_to_recognize_these_accounts/), don’t be tempted to engage in the conversation because you run the very real risk of getting yourself permabanned from the sub along with the OP and all the other replies. If you suspect a post to be a Shill, do not engage with it; just use the Report option as Spam --> Link Farming, post the subreddit link r/TheseFuckingAccounts and report the accounts to the admins at [https://www.reddit.com/report](https://www.reddit.com/report) and move on.

#Images
::General Guides::

Many subreddits require an image with a new post. You can either upload your own image from your device or use a host like Imgur. If you try and post then find one (or both) of the image or video post options isn't available, that's either because the moderators of the sub have turned it off and doesn't want that type of post at all; because the sub is NSFW, or your post is tagged NSFW. In these cases, you can't use a direct image post type (which hosts the material on Reddit's servers), but you can use a "link post" that links to the image hosted on another site instead. You can’t post videos to private subs, but again you can post a link.

The entry “Posting Images on Reddit” has more details and instructions, as does [our sister sub here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/tc63p7/how_to_create_an_image_post_new_reddit_and_app/) and also [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/tc6amr/how_to_create_a_gallery_post_multiple_images_in/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/LearnToReddit is a sister sub to this one, run by the same team, and is a safe place to learn how to post SFW images, image galleries and image links, among other essential Reddit stuff.

#Imgur
::General Guides::

An online image sharing and image hosting service with a focus on viral images and memes, [particularly those posted on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ank6i/reddit_ive_been_promising_this_to_you_for_months/).

[https://imgur.com](https://imgur.com/) is easy to use and you don’t need an account there to be able to use it. Simply upload your photo and post it as "hidden". Then copy the image’s direct link and paste it into the "link" tab of the upload section of the post. It does have a [history of not working probably for mobile users](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile/comments/6wb0b9/imgur_links_not_loading/), but the solution is this: don't use the "copy link" which shows once the upload is completed. Instead, do a right click and click "copy image location". The result is much better, especially for mobile users, as seen in these examples:

* With copy link: [https://imgur.com/225EVr4](https://imgur.com/225EVr4)
* With copy image location: [https://i.imgur.com/225EVr4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/225EVr4.jpg)

On mobile devices, bring up the right click menu by holding your finger on the screen for one to two seconds until the menu appears.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

There really is a subreddit for everything when it comes to photography. Obviously, r/photography is a great place to start, especially an [old but excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/15xui8/a_list_of_all_photography_related_subreddits/) containing a Multireddit of over 25 related subs still active. It’s important to read the rules carefully for each of these subs as they’ll all have their own strict criteria for submissions. Or post your own original photography at the less restrictive but no less lovely r/ThroughYourEyes_pics.

#IncreasinglyVerbose
::Lore and History::

Linking the time-honoured Reddit Traditions of going wildly off topic with Comment Chains and derailing a comment with Puns while adding a *soupçon* of “The Ole Reddit Switch-a-roo", r/IncreasinglyVerbose is a sub documenting those times when Redditors try to outdo each other with increasingly and unnaturally complex verbiage.  r/IncreasinglyVerbose.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

why say lot word when few word do trick? At r/DecreasinglyVerbose they take long thing and make short while short thing still has same meaning as long thing. In the middle of the chaos of both high and low inequalities, the folks at r/ConsistentlyVerbose lie in tranquility of their constants, while r/MyGodTheDescription is dedicated to the wonderful world of overly elaborate and massively inflated product descriptions which overshadow the final product.

#Insights
::Features of Reddit::

In late 2021 and again in mid 2022, Reddit introduced [Creator Statistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/q268d8/creator_statistics_and_giving_redditors_greater/) also known as [Post Insights](https://i.redd.it/nipms14lw1x81.jpg). These will be made available after a post has received at least ten views, and will be viewable by the OP (original poster) as well as by moderators in that community. If you access your profile, on each of your posts there will be a mini graph with the title "Insights", which if you click it (on mobile) [it will look like this](https://i.redd.it/flacpurvw1x81.jpg).

On desktop (or browser) the information is presented as [Total Views](https://i.redd.it/u1mkmmx6b2x81.jpg) then the “pre-fuzzed” [Upvote (vs Downvote) Rate](https://i.redd.it/p1wzyrnab2x81.jpg) followed by a [Community Karma](https://i.redd.it/uqddt1leb2x81.jpg) breakdown, then [if and how it’s been shared on Reddit](https://i.redd.it/h28mhtkhb2x81.jpg). The insights data will expire [after 45 days](https://i.redd.it/xenpfes4w1x81.jpg), so there won’t be a major backlog of performance data available.

Is this a good thing? That depends. You can see that [this post had 573 upvotes](https://i.redd.it/azbjs0vph2x81.jpg), with 31 comments. Yay! Ok, hardly front page material but that’s a nice upvote count, no? Not everyone would agree when you consider that post had 10.4k total views, however. If such discrepancies between upvotes and views annoy you, ignoring the little graph would certainly be your best bet.

Incidentally, on Old Reddit, there are other statistics available to you at [https://reddit.com/user/me/about/traffic/](https://reddit.com/user/me/about/traffic/) which you might also find interesting. So far as I know, these aren’t available on New Reddit or the mobile app.

#Internet Adages
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Internet Adages are a subset of [Eponymous Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_eponymous_laws); principles named after a person, though sometimes they can also include philosophical razors or similar observations. There are [many different lists](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Internet_law) of such [rules or laws](https://exceptionnotfound.net/15-fundamental-laws-of-the-internet/), although you may only find a few invoked regularly on Reddit.

If you find an Internet Adage I don’t define somewhere in this lexicon, it will no doubt be on either the NSFW [Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/), the NSFW [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/) or even the very NSFW [Encyclopædia Dramatica](https://dramatica.online/index.php?title=Main_Page). Google will be your friend here (other search engines are available). Or ask me! If I think more people should know it, I’ll make an entry in this encyclopaedia for it too!

For some years now, I’ve been trying to instigate “Llama’s Law”: an Internet Adage stating that “If something exists somewhere, there’s already a Subreddit for it”. I haven’t been successful. Yet…

#“Interesting” Subreddits
::Memes and Trends::

Not nearly as dull as they sound, this is a term used to loosely group together some essential subreddits for stuff of general interest. These include:

* r/mildlyinteresting
* r/interesting
* r/Damnthatsinteresting
* r/interestingasfuck

We also have r/moldlyinteresting \- a sub featuring mold - or mould if you speak The Queen’s English. Entropy comes for all things and this is a place to celebrate fungal growth which causes decay due to age or damp conditions.

For information that isn’t at all interesting we have r/notinteresting and r/notinterestingatall.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Infuriating stuff also has its own niche of Reddit in the form of r/infuriatingasfuck for the most infuriating stuff, ever. Anything less belongs in r/mildyinfuriating or r/mildlyinfuriating, r/Infuriating, r/extremelyinfuriating, r/insanelyinfuriating or r/wildlyinfuriating. Meanwhile, r/oddlyinfuriating collects the little things that make us want to break things.

#Invisible Comments
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Sometimes you might go into a post where you can't view all the comments. For instance, it might say that a post has 9 comments but when you go into them you can only see 5. This is usually because the moderators (or their bots) have removed some comments. The comment count doesn't go down when that happens because technically the comments are still there, and the mods might still be able to see them but regular Redditors can't.

This can be frustrating to see, but if a comment has been removed in this way it is almost always because it adds nothing to the conversation that’s worth seeing; probably a bot posting some variety of unrelated spam, a link-farming shill, or something else that breaks the sub’s rules. It isn’t likely to be anything related to your contribution at all; don’t forget, Reddit is the home of the bizarre [Comment Chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_comment_chain) and the [One-word Reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_one-word_reply)…

#"I regret that I have but one upvote to give."
::Memes and Trends::

A phrase posted when you see something that makes you want to upvote it to oblivion, but you can’t. Normally across Reddit, mentioning Upvotes is a dangerous game and you would quite rightly expect to be downvoted. However, one exception is the “wishful multiupvote”. Use this phrase when you see a post that you think is highly underrated and want to let everyone know it. Variants of this phrase include:

* My only regret is that I have but one upvote to give.
* I wish I had a million upvotes to give.

Similar responses that are used as a reply to a particularly relevant or witty comment that brings the point home or even back on track in a longer thread include:

* This should be the top comment.
* Here’s (or ‘Have’) my poor man’s gold🥇
* There it is. Found it everybody! You can go on with your day.
* Ding ding ding! We've got a winner!
* So much this. Anyway…
* Congratulations! You win the internet.

The origin of the phrase [“I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country”](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Nathan_Hale) is somewhat sardonic, like much of Reddit’s grimly mocking humour. Reddit loves cynicism. Reddit loves superlatives. Here, we have both!

#IRL
::Acronyms and Initials::

“In Real Life”. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us, and IRL is that pesky thing preventing you from Redditing 24/7.

---

#IRTR
::Acronyms and Initials::

This has two meanings: on Reddit it’s an acronym meaning "I read the rules." It can also mean “I resemble that remark” but that’s rarely used in Reddit.

IRTR is mainly used on subs that feature real-life photography of people to ensure there’s no doxxing or NSFW activity. Some subs will delete posts without \[irtr\] because so few people read the rules they are simply ensuring you do.  r/BeautifulFemales for instance has the following rule:

>IMPORTANT: Since most people don't read the rules, and way too many people violate the rules, put \[irtr\], which is short for I Read The Rules, at the end of your post title, otherwise you post will be automatically removed. For example: Emma Watson \[irtr\]

It’s always important to read the rules of a sub that’s new to you before contributing, and this guide will show you how to find all the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) in any sub.

Please note: some subreddits actually say on their sidebar “We would prefer that you do not tell others what IRTR means so that they can actually read the rules.”

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Despite its name, r/NoRules actually have 9 rules, the first of which is: “THERE IS NO RULES. DONT TRUST THIS (or wait maybe you should cause this is no rules so uh trust this or dont uh actually do all you want i dunno STOP WITH THIS PARADOX). But in all seriousness, please do not break Reddit Content Policy. Doing so can lead to removed posts/comments or bans.” As the sub isn’t labelled NSFW, they will moderate in order to maintain the SFW status.

r/196 has one rule (outside the general Reddit rules) which is “1. if you visit this subreddit, you must post before you leave”. They’ve also instigated [this rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/196/comments/uavnyn/no_more_porn_in_196/). Now you’ve been to that sub, don’t forget you have to post before you leave!  [In case you’re wondering, yes I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/196/comments/uhl8cm/birds_bathing_because_rule/).

#“Is there really a subreddit for everything?”
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

While it’s a running joke on Reddit to say “There’s a Subreddit for everything” to express your amazement at finding an extremely obscure or bizarre sub, there actually isn’t a Subreddit for everything. Despite the many times I try to instigate “Llama’s Law”: an Internet Adage stating that “If something exists somewhere, there’s already a Subreddit for it”, there are some Subreddits that did exist but no longer do, and some that will never exist.

In the past, some Subreddits have been removed for [their highly controversial nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversial_Reddit_communities). Likewise, there are no Subreddits for content that violates [Reddit’s Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).

However, there are still some Subreddits that don’t yet exist but could, and plenty more that have fallen out of use for inactivity, often known as ‘dead subs’. r/findareddit can help you find a sub for something, and if there isn’t anything you can either [create your own Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/2yob6r/creating_a_subreddit/) or go to r/redditrequest and ask to take over one of the many banned or abandoned subreddits that you'd like to mod. You MUST read their [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) carefully before posting a request.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Find an abandoned sub at r/inactivereddits, and there’s a sub called r/subreddit where you can share an unrecognized subreddit or find a subreddit you've been looking for.

#“Jannies”
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Short for “Janitors”, used on Reddit as a dismissive insult for Mods.  r/OutOfTheLoop recently gave an [excellent potted history of the word “Jannie”](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/pgtlkh/what_is_up_with_redditors_calling_people_and/), tracing it back to a forum from 1999 called “Something Awful” [gone, but not forgotten](https://www.somethingawful.com/) where their unpaid volunteer moderators (sound familiar?) were called Janitors.

#Jargon
::Culture and Etiquette::

Every group or subculture has its own specialized terminology, and Reddit is no exception. We have sitewide acronyms, initialisms, terms, memes, slang, references and responses, some of which will be familiar to internet users and many exclusive to Reddit. I’ve tried to list as many as possible throughout this encyclopaedia for your ease of reference so you don’t feel like an awkward animal trying desperately to break out of an impenetrable swamp.

Some subreddit types have their own dedicated lexicon, particularly those dealing with family, relationship or gender issues; especially some of the more controversial or darker ones.

I have included one or two examples of subreddit jargon throughout this encyclopaedia which occasionally appear in general Reddit, but more definitions will be found in those particular subs. There is one sub, however, which has its own jargon that I haven’t even begun to attempt.  r/wallstreetbets (or WSB) uses a combination of financial terminology and its own slang to form a [unique language that demands its own lexicon](https://www.wallstreetbets.shop/blogs/news/dissecting-the-unique-lingo-and-terminology-used-in-the-subreddit-r-wallstreetbets). Some of their more common terms that appear in general Reddit are listed here, but you should go to [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/glossary) for their full definitions.

“Lexical change” refers to a change in the meaning or use of a word, or a generational shift in preference for one word or phrase over another, and one notable example is the internet acronym “LOL”. Internet “generation gaps” mean that some of us actually remember when “lol” meant [lots of love](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/06/lol-favourite-abbreviation), and the transition to it meaning “laughing out loud” gave rise to [many an awkward situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dflpwc/comment/f33zop8/). And now, it would appear it doesn't really mean "laughing out loud" [anymore anyway](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katieheaney/the-12-meanings-of-lol).

A fun romp down memory lane [went on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mzf63a/elder_redditors_at_the_dawn_of_the_internet_what/) as one group of Redditors suddenly realised they were “elders”.

Sometimes jargon is co-opted from pop culture, as one Redditor found when asking what the meaning of [references to different coloured pills meant](https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/rdv1ux/what_are_all_these_pills_like_blue_pillpink_pill/) in some of the more [controversial](https://qz.com/1092037/the-alt-right-is-creating-its-own-dialect-heres-a-complete-guide/) areas of Reddit.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/FuckImOld is for those who can't help but think of how everything is old and you just gotta say “Fuck, I’m Old”, while r/nostalgia take pleasure in reminiscing about the good ol' days, and r/OutOfTheLoop is a subreddit to help you keep up to date with what's going on with all kinds of stuff.

#Join
::Essentials for Newbies::

If you find a subreddit about anything you're interested in, make sure to click Join so that new posts in that community will show up in your Home feed. On desktop, you can join a subreddit by clicking +Join in the upper right of a post in your feed. You can also join a sub by clicking or tapping the "Join" button at the top of the page while visiting it. There is no limit to the number of subreddits you can be Joined in, and you are not making any commitment to that community by being Joined. You need never comment or post in that sub or you can Leave and rejoin as many times as you like and nobody will ever know.

#JustUnsubbed
::Jargon and Slang::

A link or phrase posted when you’ve had enough of a subreddits’ shenanigans that you never want to see that sub in your feed again.  r/JustUnsubbed is for sharing the ‘straw that broke the camel's back’ in post form: that post which made you unsubscribe from a subreddit. Read their [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) carefully before contributing as they have a [blacklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/JustUnsubbed/comments/i6m1pw/rjustunsubbed_updated_banned_subreddits_list/) of subs that must be so infuriating you’re not even allowed to mention them.

But don’t despair.  r/JustUnsubbedAgain is for those who unsubbed from JustUnsubbed because they keep a blacklist of subs you can't talk about, and r/unsubbed is for those times when you unsub from a sub, and you just want to talk to other people about how stupid that sub is.  r/justbeenbanned is a sub to post your experience of being unfairly banned, and you’ll find similar subs in the footnotes of my entry [Ban](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_ban). I mean, where better to complain about Reddit than on Reddit itself? Reddit loves being meta.

An interesting look at some statistics on the most [frequently unsubbed subreddits on justunsubbed](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/tjk8qj/are_there_any_statistics_on_what_the_most/) found a list of over 700 subreddits, with many having multiple results..

Reddit, as you would expect, has quite a few subreddits where you can get out your strong feelings, not just about Reddit itself but life in general. These include:

* r/Vent \- to vent your frustrations!
* r/venting \- a subreddit where you can come and vent about anything and everything in your life. Get things off your chest! From the inane to the extreme, there will be no judgments here. Helpful advice is encouraged!
* r/rant \- for general ranting with no witch hunts or calling out specific subreddits, mods, companies, or individuals.
* r/offmychest \- a mutually supportive community where deeply emotional things you can't tell people you know can be told. Whether it's long-standing baggage, happy thoughts, or recent trauma, posting it here may provide some relief. We'll listen, and if you want, we'll talk. We aim to keep this a safe space.
* r/TrueOffMyChest \- a place to get personal things off your chest. Not for opinions, not for relationship advice, and not for preaching.

Finally, r/undelete keeps track of submissions that moderators remove from the top 100 in r/all. \[position in r/all | score | number of comments\].

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

On a happier note, r/JustSubbed is the place to let everyone know that you joined a sub that was new to you!

#Karma
::Essentials for Newbies::

If this is your first time reading about Reddit Karma, you should read this first: [**Reddit and Karma Explained**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/p8t966/reddit_and_karma_explained/).

Very simplistically, Karma is an approximation of the upvotes you get on your Posts and Comments minus the downvotes. The exact algorithm isn't known, but, as I said in our introduction [Reddit Karma - Your Reddit XP](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/p8t966/reddit_and_karma_explained/h9sqcti/), there isn’t a 1:1 relationship between [votes and karma](https://www.reddit.com/r/karma/wiki/index/faq/#wiki_footnotes) despite initial appearances, and both negative and positive karma are capped on individual posts and comments. Because both are cumulative, the maximum amount of negative karma you can have has been set at -100 (for comments; posts can’t go below 0) and [positive karma is capped at 5k](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/f8y9nx/spring_forward_into_reddits_2019_transparency/fioadnb/).

* **Roughly, Reddit Karma works like this:**

Reddit will never reveal the specific algorithm behind Karma, and all the following is given only as a very simplistic way of understanding a very complex set of equations.

* If a comment has 1 upvote and gets another, the commenter gets 1 karma.
* The more votes a comment or post gets, the less each individual vote is worth.
* Therefore, if a comment has, say, 5,000 upvotes (again, this is an example as the actual threshold is unknown) and 5 people upvote it (again, vague numbers), the commenter gets 1 karma.
* We don't know exactly how the scaling works, but we do know that each upvote counts less towards one's karma score as the post/comment score goes up.
* Therefore, if a comment has, say, 10,000 upvotes and 20 people upvote it, the commenter gets 1 karma.
* The amount of karma you can receive (or lose) on an individual comment is capped as above. Again, don’t confuse this figure with the number of upvotes or downvotes received.
* You can also get negative karma if you get enough downvotes. Try to avoid this as it is very hard to come back from.

This is only about new karma acquisition after a certain number of points; someone with a comment with 5,000 upvotes obviously gets more than 1 karma, but the total amount gained would be less than 5,000.

A Redditor made a visualisation of the relationship [between karma and upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/f1jszx/oc_the_relationship_between_karma_and_upvotes/) which is complex and beautiful, and marvel at some of the statistics at the [Karma Leaderboard](https://www.karmalb.com/). Input your own username to see [how you compare](https://www.karmalb.com/user/llamageddon01) with everyone else, and remind yourself that the only karma you actually NEED is enough to get you into the subreddits you want to be in.

* **What does Reddit itself say about Karma?**

The official Reddit information about [karma is here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204511829-What-is-karma-). There are four kinds of Karma: Post, Comment, Awarder and Awardee and you can find your personal amount of earned Karma by clicking on your Profile in the top right hand corner or by clicking the blue link of your username on one of your own posts. You can also check your Karma breakdown here: [http://old.reddit.com/u/me/overview](http://old.reddit.com/u/me/overview).

Another unofficial but quite comprehensive guide to Karma can be [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/karma/wiki/index/faq), and there is another detailed explanation of Karma [here, with other useful links too](https://www.reddit.com/r/karma/comments/kkis5i/read_this_before_posting_weve_noticed_that_the/).

* **Types of Karma**

**Comment Karma** comes from the votes given on that comment, and it comes from both Parent and Child comments. Reddit will automatically give you one upvote for each and every comment you make which you should regard as a “thank you” for participating. This will not earn you Comment Karma but will stop your comment from appearing as if it has already been downvoted.

* As a new Redditor, this is what you should be concentrating on right now, and our guide to [Participating on Reddit: Commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/p8t966/reddit_and_karma_explained/h9sr5e0/) will give you more details, hints and tips on growing this count.

**Post Karma** is earned by making or crossposting posts. When you submit a Post, all votes on that post will be [converted to Karma](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204511829-What-is-karma-). Reddit will automatically give you one upvote for each and every post you make which you should regard as a “thank you” for participating. This will not earn you Post Karma but will stop your post from appearing as if it has already been downvoted.

* As a new Redditor, this is what you should be concentrating on next, and our guide to [Participating on Reddit: Posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/p8t966/reddit_and_karma_explained/h9ss4vt/) will give you more details, hints and tips on growing this count.

**Award Karma / Awardee Karma** are [recent additions to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/iz7nnb/award_karma/) where you get karma for giving Awards (Awarder Karma) and for being given Awards (Awardee Karma). Receiving an award is a signal of recognition from another Redditor, so it was decided it should earn a nominal amount of Karma, and that the recipient should get more Karma when the award costs more. These two factors make up the Awardee Karma calculation.

* As a new Redditor, Award Karma is not helpful to you at all in getting to the point where you can post and comment freely across Reddit without restrictions.

Awarder Karma can earn you a Trophy on your profile showing how generous with giving out Gold & Platinum (Gilding Level Trophy) Argentium (Argentium Club) and Ternion (Ternion Club) you are. Giving smaller awards counts towards Award karma. Award/Awardee Karma like normal Karma is not given at a 1:1 ratio, and again, the figures are shown on your Profile.

Something else you should know is that individual subreddits have the option to hide vote visibility for up to a day, as a method of encouraging legitimate voting and discouraging the “bandwagon effect”. Upvotes, downvotes and the ensuing karma are still being counted and will eventually become visible. These posts may have the word *vote* instead of [displaying the number](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204511579-Why-can-t-I-see-how-many-upvotes-a-post-or-comment-has-sometimes-).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/karma is another place to learn about Reddit Karma, but read their [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) before participating as they are not a free karma pity party. However, the intrepid Redditor u/PorkyPain has one of the best breakdowns ever there on how to get [1 million karma](https://www.reddit.com/r/karma/comments/ib5oas/tips_and_tricks_to_get_karma_in_reddit/) and is very much worth your while to read.

#Karma Farming
::Essentials for Newbies::

Also known as “Karma Whoring”. Basically asking - or begging - for upvotes and / or karma without being engaged in conversation. Posts asking for or even talking about Karma or awards (e.g. “Upvote all my comments and I’ll upvote yours” or “What’s an award?”) will be at best downvoted or may even earn you a ban. There are very few exceptions to this; your Cakeday being the only legitimate time you can ask for Karma in certain places, or in subs with the specific purpose of talking about (but not asking for) Karma such as r/Karma or, of course, r/NewToReddit.

#Karma Farms
::Essentials for Newbies::

You will no doubt come across Subreddits which offer upvotes or karma for no or little effort. They don’t hide their intentions of promising you upvotes (or karma) in return for your giving upvotes to their posts with no other interaction. These places are known as “karmafarms” and you should avoid them. They are easy enough to spot from their names, and DO NOT be tempted by them no matter what you might read there. They can be easy traps to fall into because some of those upvote scores on older posts look amazing to a new user, but those scores have been manipulated (See: [Vote Manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/9/#wiki_vote_manipulation)) which is very much against the [Reddit rules](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043066412).

The few upvotes you’ll get in a karmafarm as a genuine user aren’t worth the risk to the integrity of your account. Even if you aren’t caught by Reddit itself, posting in subreddits meant for “gaming” the Reddit system can and will get you banned from participating in some major subreddits that you may want - or need - to use in the future because a lot of moderators see them as a way of circumventing karma requirements to post or comment in their community. You can read more about this in [User-History Based Moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/9/#wiki_user-history_based_moderation).

* **Who posts in Karma Farms?**

As I said above, most new users don’t actually get that many upvotes from those subs and there’s a reason for that: those subs aren’t used by regular new people looking for early Karma at the start of their Reddit journey. Karma farms are mostly populated by fake accounts: Bots and their Alts with no real intention of engaging at all on Reddit. They exist solely to farm karma for their other Bot Alts, widely used by marketers and political groups with things to promote illicitly on Reddit. They are only there to collect upvotes in a “voting-go-round” with each other to increase their karma to pass the minimum requirements that exist on most big subs.

Spambots are a very real problem on Reddit. They’re not hard to spot once you do a little digging as the comments they make are usually generic and the pictures they post (when they do) are just quickly farmed from Google pretending to be from an actual person. But they rely on the fact that most of us don’t check everyone’s profile or history before responding to them. With enough votes, a fake profile can appear real enough to trick people, and apparently this is causing some mayhem and a real problem in the subs that deal with stocks and cryptocurrencies.

* **Why go to all that trouble?**

Simple: there is real life money involved. Promotional companies that want to do "organic advertising" or political astroturfing need older accounts with lots of karma to appear legitimate, and so do the sketchy companies who want you to go to their malware, dodgy advertisement, dropship, phishing or credit-card scam sites. Gaining karma will increase their ability to post items such as T-Shirts, prints, mugs or other ephemerals with an innocuous caption saying things like “Got this for a friend” or “This arrived today”. Fall for one of those posts at your peril.

These farmed profiles are also being sold to people who want to seem legitimate or to have credibility in Reddit, especially in subs with real-life money or influence involved. Don’t believe me? Take a look at [this experiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/pmqk28/i_bought_some_upvotes_out_of_sheer_curiosity_and/) and realise why most subs have an anti-spambot filter and mods with a heavy banhammer. That Redditor just used one of the grey market sites out there. There is a lot more [information and discussion here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/n5co35/what_is_going_on_with_rkidsarefuckingstupid/) about this issue, and [not just in Reddit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2016/12/14/how-we-bought-reddit-for-200/?sh=410b00f444a8).

* **OK, so why are Karma Farms allowed to exist?**

That’s a very [good question](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/s8mfm5/dear_admins_could_you_please_confirm_are_karma/) and one that has [been asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/cpe06f/why_are_give_me_karma_subreddits_allowed/) many times with [plenty of debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/qyhorh/why_are_free_karma_subreddits_allowed_to_exist/)but no official [conclusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/jmohns/why_are_free_karma_subreddits_still_allowed/).

In February 2020, the Reddit CEO made a [statement about Karma farming](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/f8y9nx/spring_forward_into_reddits_2019_transparency/fiodt6l/) saying: *The answer is right now we’re in between a rock and a hard place. We want new users to be able to discover Reddit, but aggressive karma rules, which mods set up when Reddit had very limited tools, make it very hard for first-time users to contribute. Karma farms are a bad solution to this, which is why we’re working on tools like Crowd Control that limit the damage bad actors can cause without overly punishing well-meaning new users. I've been proposing an idea around karma reciprocity - letting communities take into account a user's karma in other communities.*There has been no official statement since.

* **How to avoid being caught in the crossfire**

After spending ten years on Reddit, u/ActionScripter9109 compiled an excellent written guide to the growth of dishonest posting on Reddit, called [The Weird World of Spam, Scams, and Manipulation on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/ActionScripter9109/comments/qau2uz/karma_farming_and_you_a_guide_to_the_weird_world/) with insights on how to spot such goings-on and what you can do to guard against being manipulated. The discussion about it [was fascinating too](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/qauwv0/summarizing_and_addressing_the_rise_of_bots/).

Another guide to spotting these fake accounts [is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/42mkxv/bots_on_reddit_that_try_to_appear_human/) and there is more information in our entry on [Spambot Spotting](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/7/#wiki_spambot_spotting).

If you are at all serious about being on Reddit, you need to build up karma in the same way we all did - slowly but with quality. Reddit is not a “race to the top”, it’s there to be enjoyed for what it is - a content sharing platform where you decide what level of interaction you want with other Redditors. Just set out to be a good person, and think of your karma as being your internet legacy.

#kys
::Jargon and Slang::

“kill your self”. This lower-case initialism is mostly found in teen gaming communities as a way of “trash talking” or an “edgy” way to say [“fuck you”](https://www.dictionary.com/e/acronyms/kys/).

“kys” is favoured by children and teens, most of whom argue that it’s just a joke, and when challenged on it will adopt a faux innocence, claiming their linguistic superiority in informing you that the word "kys" literally means "kiss" in Danish, or can also mean "keep yourself safe", hiding behind the phenomenon of Lexical Change, (a shift in the meaning or use of a word) while meta-trolling with an unholy mixture of whitewashing, gaslighting, Brandolini’s Law and Poe’s Law to try and bullshit their way out of it.

When you're an angry person with poor impulse control, one of the ways you learn to channel your own anger is to lash out and try to hurt others. Psychologists often speak of the [“online disinhibition effect”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect) \- our tendency to say things on the internet that we would never dare to say in real life. Restraint and teens rarely go hand in hand, but regardless, it’s actually quite sad that we now have a commonly used shorthand to provoke, suggest or even just refer to suicide in fun.

Suicide is a serious subject. This kind of language should not be taken lightly. Please report anyone who says [“kys”, “kill yourself”](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/p70ixy/why_should_someone_that_messages_modmail_go_kill/) or similar phrases on Reddit. Inviting someone to commit suicide is against Reddit’s [code of conduct](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and may well [incur a ban](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/hqxc89/does_it_warrant_a_ban_if_a_user_says_kill/fy2hzxk/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

If you see a genuine post or comment about suicidal feelings in a community, it can be overwhelming, and you may feel like you don’t know what to do. But you can help, and there are [resources on Reddit available for you and the person you’re worried about](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513931-What-do-I-do-if-someone-talks-about-seriously-hurting-themselves-or-is-considering-suicide-).

When you tap the three dots in the [top right corner of a user’s profile page](https://i.redd.it/jqtjfb501ox81.jpg) there is an option called 'get them help and support'. On selecting this, Reddit sends out an automated message with some suicide helpline phone numbers and links.

The moderators of r/SuicideWatch maintain a list of FAQs, information, and resources at r/SWResources and a worldwide [list of hotlines](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines). If you’ve lost someone to suicide, r/SuicideBereavement is there for you.

There’s also a useful list of subreddits for [advice or support on depression or other mental health issues here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/comments/dmic6o/advice_mental_health_subreddits/).

#LARP; LARPer
::Acronyms and Initials::

“Live Action Role-Playing”. A game where the participants physically portray historical, fantasy or other characters. Unfortunately, Reddit attracts LARPers in the form of Internet trolls - people pretending to be something they're really not, especially on Subreddits dedicated to Relationships, Advice, Conspiracy Theories, Health, Politics, and Religion.

LARPing on Reddit can also be talking big online about some kind of physical, real-world action you're going to take without actually having any intention of leaving your computer, or even throwing out controversial opinions as being your own simply to gain a reaction. [Finding a costume for this might not be easy though](https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/8dj8mw/larping_trolling/).

Because Reddit has zero barrier to entry and is based on anonymity, we even attract [deliberate LARPers](https://medium.com/@alexanderlago11/how-to-troll-on-reddit-a7d3e0eb260b). You should note that because of this risk, the r/IAmA Subreddit requires [stringent evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/wiki/proof?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) of identity. Some other subreddits [do this out of necessity too](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/gumxuy/what_is_bpt_country_club_and_how_do_i_get/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Reddit has seen more than one “time traveller” in its time.  [John Titor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Titor) is supposedly a time traveller from the year of 2036 and r/JohnTitor (and r/Unexplained to a wider extent) is the place to read about and discuss his predictions.  r/TrueReddit is just one sub that has tried [to unravel his secrets](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/1dsscf/the_mystery_of_john_titor_hoax_or_time_traveler/) over the years. r/UnresolvedMysteries have also had [a long fascination](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/il608y/reexamining_the_predictions_of_john_titor/) with his claims.

Some time ago, u/HarutoTanaka also claimed to be a time traveller from 2036 and [made reference to John Titor](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/34fqze/i_am_a_time_traveler_from_2036_ask_me_anything/) in their initial post in r/casualiama. John Dee, or u/johndeehist claims to be a Time Historian sent back from 2154 to our present to experience several years. r/timetravelhub spent some time [examining his claims](https://www.reddit.com/r/timetravelhub/comments/kpxvug/rjohndeehist_s_amas_time_traveller_from_2146_a/). There have been many more popping up [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/1erss3/i_am_a_time_traveler_from_the_late_2030s_ama/), with mixed [response](https://www.reddit.com/r/timetravel/comments/2fmubm/greetings_i_am_a_time_traveler_form_the_year_2048/). There will be more; there will always be more.

r/timetravelercaught is a fun subreddit. Sometimes old media, film and photo, catches someone who dresses or acts in a way that they could be a time traveller from another time, like perhaps [Greta Thunberg](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/22/greta-thunberg-time-traveller-1891-photo)? Another sub to discuss all things time travel whether fiction or not so much is r/timetravel.

And did this gentleman time travel to save his own life? [It would appear so…..](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmagicfuckery/comments/gc6ybo/this_guy_is_a_time_traveler/).

#LearnToReddit
::Essentials for Newbies::

This is a place to learn and practice using Reddit in regards to posting different post types, commenting, adding and editing flairs, creating spoiler text and so on. Run by the same moderating team as this sub, the community will feedback on your post to let you know how you did, share tips, or help you get it right next time.

* r/NewToReddit is to help you learn about Reddit culture, karma, navigation and much more.
* r/LearnToReddit is a place for practical learning with tutorials on posting images, using *special* text and other features.

Please make sure to check the rules before posting! Thank you :D

You might be interested to know that the first truly popular post on Reddit was called [“Test post please ignore”](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/), and was posted in 2009 in r/pics, *without a picture*. Because Redditors will Reddit, the entire community rallied to reject his request to ignore the post, and “test post please ignore” became the most upvoted post on reddit for the next 2 years with an incredible 26,750 upvotes. Incidentally, OP was the [first Redditor to reach 100,000 karma](https://web.archive.org/web/20150627052314/http://www.brentcsutoras.com:80/2008/01/18/qgyh2-reaches-reddit-record-100000-karma/). It’s now a [Reddit Tradition™](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/sphocx/test_post_please_ignore/) not to ignore a post with that title where it’s made appropriately.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/test and r/sandboxtest are other places to try out that Reddit thing, but without feedback or additional help. Post a link to your site, or a text post with a link in it at r/TestMySite and users can come test it and provide feedback.  r/usertesting is a subreddit for user testing sites - sites where you test websites for people to get paid.

#“Learning” Subreddits
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Not nearly as dull as they sound, this is a term used to loosely group together some essential subreddits for hints, tips and advice on all those little things that make a big difference in our lives. These include:

* r/LearnUselessTalents
* r/lifehacks
* r/LifeProTips
* r/todayilearned
* r/YouShouldKnow

The best content from some of these subreddits is collected at r/knowyourshit.

There are even more subreddits for actual learning, such as r/StudyTips and r/GetStudying. [Navigating Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/p8t966/reddit_and_karma_explained/h9ssh6c/) will help you find that specific topic or institution of interest to you.

#Legal Advice on Reddit
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Social media isn’t usually the place for sound advice on real-world problems, but Reddit does have more than its fair share of [communities based on and around legal issues](https://www.legal.io/articles/5170399/20-places-on-Reddit-where-attorneys-legal-professionals-and-people-with-legal-questions-gather). A good place to start would be r/LegalAdvice where their [wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index/) is full of information and their sidebar (About tab on mobile) has a comprehensive list of subreddits dealing with legal advice in countries other than the USA.

It is vital to keep in mind that any advice received to responses to questions on any legal subreddit [do not constitute legal advice](https://www.contractscounsel.com/b/reddit-legal-advice) and you should always seek your own legal counsel before proceeding with any matters concerning the law.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/bestoflegaladvice collects all the greatest posts from r/legaladvice and its sister subreddits in one location, and when someone provides bad legal advice, relay it to r/badlegaladvice. For general off-topic legal discussion, go over to r/legaladviceofftopic.

#LeopardsAteMyFace
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A link or phrase posted when someone is surprised at being negatively affected by the consequences of their own political beliefs and actions. The phrase *'I never thought leopards would eat MY face,' sobs woman who voted for the Leopards Eating People's Faces Party* satirises those who happily vote for negative consequences for others only to be dismayed when those consequences also affect them. r/LeopardsAteMyFace.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

*Schadenfreude* is the experience of pleasure, joy, or self-satisfaction that comes from learning of or witnessing the troubles, failures, or humiliation of another, and so naturally, Reddit has embraced this concept wholeheartedly, giving rise to many communities such as:

* r/schadenfreude
* r/BrexitAteMyFace
* r/COVIDAteMyFace
* r/HermanCainAward
* r/Trumpgret

There will be more out there. It’s always important to read the rules of any unfamiliar subreddit before contributing, and even more so in subreddits which may identify individuals.

#Linking
::Essentials for Newbies::

You may be asked to link another source, comment or subreddit at some time, so here’s how to do it:

* **To post a Hyperlink:**

You can simply copy and paste a web URL into your comment. However, it often can be huge and full of [additional symbols and letters](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033863?hl=en) often looking like this at the end:  [/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://i.redd.it/ukjdxr1p7ux81.jpg). To tidy it up a bit, you can safely delete all this clutter up to and including the question mark and the link will still work.

* **To embed a Hyperlink:**

Reddit provides an easy way to simplify a link both for mobile and desktop. The “Reply” box has an icon with two interlocked rings. Using this link will give you the opportunity to embed your hyperlink so it looks like [a text link like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/lw4gp4/a_guide_to_reddit_lingo/guht7e5/). Another way of doing this is to sandwich the text you want to show up between square brackets \[ \] immediately followed by the hyperlink sandwiched between parentheses ( )

* **To post a link to another Reddit post or comment:**

When you’re reading a Post, on the top of the screen is a three dots pull down Hamburger Menu, where one of the options is “Share” allowing you to copy the link to paste into a reply, or an icon at the bottom of the post with an upwards arrow in an open box, marked “Share” with the same option. At the bottom of each Comment next to the Edit button is either the same three dots menu, again with the same option.

* **To post a link to another Subreddit:**

Simply type r/ in front of the name of the Subreddit you want to link to. It’s important to spell the sub name correctly but it isn’t case-sensitive, so r/newtoreddit will work just as well as r/NewToReddit.

* **To post a link to another Redditor’s profile:**

Simply type u/ in front of the username of the Redditor you want to link to, for example u/llamageddon01. This is also known as a “ping” or a “tag” and that user will get a notification whenever you use it in a comment.

Do not use the ‘link’ button or Markdown Text to trick or confuse users, such as attempts on [clickjacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking), [spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack) or hiding a Subreddit's name to replace it for another in an attempt to deceive readers. The first two will get you permabanned and the third, if not against the rules of the subreddit will certainly garner negative reports and downvotes. The only time such a “bait and switch” is considered acceptable (and the jury’s still out on this one) is for [an ‘appropriate’ Rickroll](https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0).

Short links are generally banned on Reddit, and if your post or comment includes a short link, [it will probably go straight to Reddit’s Spam Filter](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/25uk2o/are_known_link_shorteners_completely_banned_from/).

#Llama’s Law
::Lore and History::

For some years now I’ve been trying to instigate an Eponymous Law. I haven’t always gone by this username (u/llamageddon01) on the internet; like just about everyone over time I’ve had a succession of internet identities in many different places, some more visible than others, some more popular than others, but none of them have gone particularly viral for any reason.

* **Attempt 1**

Last century (I’ll never get tired of saying that!), I helped on a live chat for a popular computer game. Dealing with the mixture of confused, perplexed and angry users from all over the world, of all ages, with mixed computer and English language skills led me to promote the motto among my fellow “gurus” [“The benefit of the doubt is the best gift you could give anyone“](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/what_happens_when_you_give_people_the_benefit_of_the_doubt). It might not have become Llama’s Law but I still count this as one of my life (and Reddit) mottos.

* **Attempt 2**

Not long after, I became a regular helper on several related Internet Forums, where I coined my first Internet Adage, stating that [“In any list of “unwritten rules” there’ll always be one missing and it’ll always be the one you break”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspoken_rule). I wasn’t successful. I don’t know why; this adage is as true now as it’s ever been.

* **Attempt 3**

My next attempt was a corollary to Hanlon's razor: [“Never attribute to strategy what can be explained by raw emotion”](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_.201Cnever_attribute_to_strategy_what_can_be_explained_by_raw_emotion.201D), following several heated meetings when I was on a fundraising board for an animal charity building a hospital. The hospital got built (yay!) and I resigned the day of the official opening, quite exhausted. The other board members had this inscribed on a plaque for me which unfortunately got lost in an office move. As this was IRL and not interwebs related, this might not actually count for this list, but it’s my list and it’s on here.

* **Attempt 4**

Another Llama Law I’ve tried to establish since first joining Reddit many years ago (not on this current username) is [“If something exists somewhere, there’s already a Subreddit for it”](https://thenextweb.com/news/heres-a-list-of-weird-subreddits-to-ruin-your-day). I haven’t been successful with that one either, despite its unwavering truth.

* **Attempt 5**

The closest I’ve ever come to success was: [“When you’re demonstrating something that should happen to multiple items at once, there’ll always be one that doesn’t co-operate”](https://www.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/qtmgf8/comment/hkkoxea/). If you can count receiving under 250 upvotes as “success”, that is.

* **Attempt 6**

During 2022’s “Place” event, I realised something I had been peripherally noticing over the years, which I codified into a potential Llamageddon’s Law: [“No matter how wholesome a public or crowdsourced artwork is, someone will always add a peen”](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/tuuv8k/biggest_plot_twist_in_the_entire_history_of_canvas/). This reminded me of the glory days of the [cdc](https://b3ta.com/dictionary/define/cdc/) on the wonderful meme-generating website [https://b3ta.com](https://b3ta.com/) and why I never bought a drawing tablet.

* **Attempt 7**

It’ll come. And readers here will be the first to know. Who knows; with your help, one day I might be successful. [But for the moment…](https://i.redd.it/2ff5i98qrux81.jpg).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[Camelids](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/gjdyup/til_that_llamas_and_alpacas_are_most_closely/) are well represented on Reddit.  r/llama and r/llamas are all about llamas; r/LlamasUnleashed is a subreddit for all things “Llamas Unleashed”; r/alpaca describes itself as Alpacapalooza! (and why not); r/AlpacaSelfies is for pictures of Alpacas, sometimes with humans, and r/LlamasEatingBananas is…well…quiet these days.

#Location Reddits
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Reddit is [used worldwide](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/61vzin/popularity_of_reddit_by_country_4500_x_2234/). Statistics from [here](https://thrivemyway.com/reddit-statistics/) show that two hundred and twenty-two million users live in the US, which makes up 48% of the Reddit community. Other countries with large user bases include the UK (7.6%), Canada (7.4%), Australia (3.8%), and Germany (3.3%). Another breakdown of global Redditors [can be seen here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/phhu9s/oc_reddit_traffic_by_country/) as a pair of graphs.

r/LocationReddits is the home of the ‘Global List of Local Reddits’. Any location subreddit - for a city, town, village, state, province, prefecture, territory, county, country, continent, or region - can be found on or [added to the list here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocationReddits/wiki/index). Some of these following lists are quite old and may well be incomplete, but other lists of regional subreddits include:

* [Africa](https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/ejww1/list_of_african_subreddits/)
* [Asia](https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/ejw6q/list_of_asian_subreddits/)
* [Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/ejgwj/list_of_european_subreddits/)
* [North America (excluding USA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/ejyes/list_of_north_american_subreddits_excluding_usa/)

* [Oceania](https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/ejx5a/list_of_oceania_subreddits/)

Regional subreddits exist for other subjects too! Here’s just a sample:

* [Pokémon GO](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/wiki/regionalsubs/)
* [Food](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/oenh3/the_big_list_of_regional_food_subreddits/)
* [Sports Teams](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/wiki/teams)
* [Politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditlists/comments/josdr/list_of_political_subreddits/)

r/geopolitics is focused on the relationship between politics and territory. Through geopolitics they attempt to analyse and predict the actions and decisions of nations, or other forms of political power, by means of their geographical characteristics and location in the world. In a broader sense, geopolitics studies the general relations between countries on a global scale.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

We have subs about flags on Reddit. Oh my do we have subs about flags on Reddit!

r/vexillology is a subreddit for those who enjoy learning about flags, the history behind them, and their design characteristics, and r/flags is a subreddit dedicated to flags, whether it be flags that are of countries, organisations, your own personal fantasies, or anything related to flags, while r/vexillologycirclejerk exists to put the ‘lol’ into vexillology.  r/ImaginaryFlags shares imaginary flags, and r/somnivexillology collects recreations of flags seen in dreams.  r/badflagsis a subreddit for posting flag mistakes, especially badly made flags, but not ugly or badly designed flags; those you’ll find at r/vexillologygore for flags that are unironically awful and r/eyehurtingflags for the truly bizarre flags.

r/MapPorn specialises in high quality images of maps, and r/Map_Porn is a subreddit dedicated to the sharing, discussion, and appreciation of maps, while r/mapporncirclejerk does exactly as you would expect.  r/imaginarymaps invite you to share maps you have made of alternate history, fantasy, sci-fi or anything really, while r/imaginarymapscj is a circlejerk sub for…. imaginary maps.

#Locked; Padlocked
::Essentials for Newbies::

Sometimes you will see a little yellow padlock icon on a post. This is because it has been locked by the moderators. You should note that:

* No new comments by users can be posted on a locked post. Everything else about that post is unaffected, including voting.
* Moderators and admins can still post comments on a locked thread.
* Existing comments on a locked post can still be edited or deleted by their authors.
* Moderators can unlock a locked post at any time, at which point new comments can be posted again.
* An individual comment within a post can be padlocked, meaning nobody can reply to it but the rest of the post can remain open to new comments or replies.

Mods lock posts for many reasons. A post or comment may be locked if a moderation team see a violation of the subreddit's (or Reddit’s) rules; if a debate threatens to escalate into a flame war, or simply because it was a contest/vote/suggestions post in which submissions have ended. In mid 2021 on r/NewToReddit, we discovered that some new Redditors had been asking questions in old posts which never got an upvote, let alone an answer. Because of that, we started locking posts over 7 days old, giving the following reasons:

* We want to keep the focus on fresh content. Posts won’t be removed so they can still be read but any new insights or questions won’t be lost to those who’ve read it and moved on.
* New users need to gain Post Karma genuinely. They can only do that by actually making new posts!
* New users need to gain Comment Karma, and having an active post will gain them more comment experience and karma than an inactive one.
* It will reduce how many new questions get asked on older posts which might be completely overlooked.

Reddit also automatically locks all posts over 6 months old, and these will show a yellow box icon. Posts locked due to age can no longer be voted or commented on. This is [actually optional](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/py2xy2/voting_commenting_on_archived_posts/)now, but don’t expect much response if you want to revitalise an old post as the only person seeing your comment will be the Redditor you’re replying to, and of course, Reddit doesn’t “bump” posts up the hierarchy in the way some forums or bulletin boards do.

#Logical Fallacies
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Reddit, more than any other social media outlet, is about discussion. With millions of worldwide users of all ages from all walks of life daily, the quality of each argument in any thread varies from comment to comment with respect to logical strength, credibility, relevance, the balance of evidence, or demographic bias and perspective. There is nothing wrong with trying to persuade someone else to look at a topic from your point of view, particularly if you present credible evidence in your favour. Quite often, however, users won’t be able to do that and will use other devices of argumentation to sway thinking instead, such as Logical Fallacies.

A logical fallacy is an error in reasoning common enough to warrant a fancy name. Fallacies can be either illegitimate arguments or irrelevant points, and are frequently deployed on Reddit during any debate where it looks like you might be winning.

* **Fallacies come in two flavours:**

There are two major categories of logical fallacy, which in turn break down into a [wide range of types of fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies), each a persuasion technique with their own unique ways of trying to trick you or your readers into agreement or disagreement.

* [Formal Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy)

Most formal fallacies are errors of logic: the conclusion doesn’t really “follow from” or is not supported by the premise. Either the premises are untrue or the argument is invalid. They are all types of *non sequitur* \- a conclusion or reply that doesn't follow logically from the previous statement.

* [Informal Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy)

An informal fallacy denotes an error in the content of your argument. These take many forms and are widespread in everyday discourse. Very often they involve bringing irrelevant information into an argument, or are based on assumptions that, when examined, prove to be incorrect. The ideas might be arranged correctly, but something you said isn’t quite right.

* **Say that again?**

Formal fallacies are created when the relationship between premises and conclusion does not hold up or when premises are unsound; informal fallacies are more dependent on misuse of language and of evidence. Knowing which one you are being accused of is possibly more knowledge than the user making the accusation has, in which case you can go to town on wrapping their argument up in fancy-schmancy words. Unless you’re in one of the subs devoted to serious academic discourse in which case you’ll already have dismissed a lot of what I’ve said as puerile oversimplification.

* **What to look out for**

A very useful list of Reddit’s favourite logical fallacies [can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/npkc7/eli5_all_the_common_logical_fallacies_that_you/), and the comments section details even more.

By far the best guides to any kind of critical thinking are found at [https://www.schoolofthought.org](https://www.schoolofthought.org/) where their section on [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/) comes complete with easy to read illustrated and downloadable resources.

Another useful resource is this searchable database called [“The Ultimate Collection of Over 300 Logical Fallacies”](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/), or this fairly academic [alphabetical one here](https://utminers.utep.edu/omwilliamson/ENGL1311/fallacies.htm).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/philosophy is Reddit’s portal for public philosophy if you’re serious about discussing fallacious thinking, and r/askphilosophy aims to provide serious, well-researched answers to philosophical questions.  r/Stoicism is a community committed to learning about and applying Stoic principles and techniques, and had an interesting discussion on [protecting yourself from being persuaded by logical fallacies or bad arguments here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/ofl2js/how_to_protect_yourself_from_being_persuaded_by/).

#"Looks like you've been doing that a lot.”
::Essentials for Newbies::

Sometimes when you’re posting, you might get this error message pop up: ["Looks like you've been doing that a lot. Take a break for X minutes before trying again."](https://i.redd.it/n1yffajuhox81.jpg), where X has been reported to being any number between 30 seconds to 30 minutes. And yes, it’s annoying. It's something every user has been through, and can happen for several reasons:

* It means your karma is too low to post in that particular sub without time limits.  [This will pass with time](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204579879-Why-am-I-being-told-You-re-doing-that-too-much-).
* Sometimes Reddit’s servers occasionally glitch and you press “send” several times because it looks like your post or comment hasn’t gone through…. until the glitch is over and you see that [it did, multiple times](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/oe2n4m/why_are_there_multiple_duplicate_comments_by_the/).
* It can happen if you’re [using a VPN](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/nh2tsy/i_got_the_error_message_looks_like_youve_been/). There are many reports [that Reddit isn’t compatible with VPN usage](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/locor3/new_error_message_youve_been_posting_a_lot_take_a/) and gives this error message.

#Lost for Words
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

It happens to the best of us. Small-talk, despite sounding anodyne, does not come easy to many of us. Clumsy or tactless conversation is a staple of most coming-of-age films for a reason and the number of books devoted to improving the social skills of people of all ages could sink a battleship. You need Reddit Karma, so you need to comment, but what?

A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. With this in mind, a good tool to employ is the principle of the [Five Ws and How *aka* 5W1H](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) of information gathering:

* Who
* What
* When
* Where
* Why
* How

Let me add another tool to your box - the principle of the Five Styles of Reddit commenting:

* [Adorable Positivity](https://www.happier.com/blog/nice-things-to-say-100-compliments/)
* [Puns or Pop-culture References](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeschoolRecovery/comments/7r5yl6/a_guide_to_the_100_most_important_pop_culture/)
* [The Wishful Multiupvote](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hfi2e/most_cliche_reddit_comments/)
* And if all else fails... [Hated Hivemind-isms](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/7dc49k/what_reddit_cliches_wind_you_up_the_most/)
* The Last Resort... [Circlejerk Copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/mr8g9h/reddit/)

These are pretty much given in the order you should employ them. The last two might not win you any favours in some subs so use them carefully.

* **Related resources**

If you want further tips on the art of saying nothing while saying something, [Big Talk about Small Talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/ovodna/sunday_funday/) and part 2 [More Big Talk about Small Talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/ph6vxv/more_big_talk_about_small_talk/) might be of interest.

A Redditor was kind enough in 2019 to share a [“small-talk cheat sheet”](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/b8uarr/i_made_a_small_talk_cheat_sheet_for_a_client/) they made for a client they were coaching, with a downloadable pdf version too. They have an excellent website [“Social Confidence for Nerdy Guys”](https://www.techlecticism.com/) which I can attest can help with social confidence for “Nerdy Gals” too.

You can also improve your debating skills by knowing [some common logical fallacies](https://academicinfluence.com/inflection/study-guides/logical-fallacies) which are often used in argument [and debate](https://thebestschools.org/magazine/15-logical-fallacies-know/).

#“Lost in New”
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A post will often be referred to as being “lost in new”. It simply means a post that gets swept along in all the myriad of new posts to Reddit, never making it to the front page. It took some Redditor a lifetime maybe to put some of his thoughts down, looking around at the world and life, and then in two minutes, boom! it's all over. Lost in new. Some of us will forever be lost in new regardless of the quality of our posts but that’s fine, because Reddit is strange like that.

#Lostredditors
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A link or phrase posted when the OP appears to have posted in the wrong subreddit. r/Lostredditors.

There is also r/lostlostredditors, and here’s what they say that sub is actually for:

>Okay! So I’ve just remembered that this sub exists and noticed a lot of the posts here don’t fit the sub. So let me explain.  
>  
>A dummy posts something on r/lostredditors because they think it’s a sub to post on when you don’t know where to post something. The actual correct subs for that would be r/RedditInReddit or r/findareddit.  
>  
>2. The lovely folks here notice that this has happened, take a screenshot, and post it here.  
>  
>The end.

The *actual* subreddit for things you want to post that you don't know what subreddit they go in is r/LostRedditor. Reddit loves being meta.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/lostmedia is for discussing pieces of lost media and the searches for them, and the most mysterious song on the internet has been sought since 2007 but to this day it remains unidentified. Go over to r/TheMysteriousSong and be absolutely fascinated by the sheer amount of searching worldwide that so far hasn’t found any trace of its origin.
