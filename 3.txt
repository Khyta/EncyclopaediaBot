#Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon  
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Very simplistically, this phenomenon occurs when the thing you've just noticed, experienced or been told about suddenly crops up constantly. This is a Confirmation Bias also known as a [Frequency Illusion](https://lighthouse.mq.edu.au/article/july-2020/What-is-the-Baader-Meinhof-Phenomenon). Those of us old enough to remember [the once notorious West German Baader-Meinhof gang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction) may wonder how this [phrase came about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion), and the St. Paul Minnesota Pioneer Press online commenting board was the unlikely source of the name. In 1994, a reader was talking to a friend about the gang, and the next day, the friend referred him to an article in that day’s newspaper in which the organisation was mentioned, decades after it had any reason to be in the news.

Also known as Frequency Bias or Recency Illusion, the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon is a mix of coincidence and when your awareness of something increases leading you to believe something is happening more, even if that’s not actually the case. By the way; have you seen the number of [Fiat 500s](https://smartcdn.prod.postmedia.digital/driving/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome-image-404654.png) on the roads recently? You will now.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[r/coincidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/coincidence/) is for screenshots of alignments of random points, [r/GlitchInTheMatrix](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/) is a sub for posting pictures and videos of strange occurrences and [r/Glitch\_in\_the\_Matrix](https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/) is for "Eye-witness event(s) that cannot be explained with critical thinking." As always, please read the rules before posting in an unfamiliar sub.

#“Bait-and-Switch” or “The ole Reddit Bait-and-Switch”  
::Tropes and Oneupmanship::

A confidence trick based on a false claim or enticement to dupe the unsuspecting victim into doing something they didn’t want to do.

#Ban
::Essentials for Newbies::

A moderator (mod) can ban you from a Subreddit for whatever reason they want. Moderators are not required to give you “notice” or any kind of prior warning before making a decision, so if a mod makes the decision to ban you, there really isn’t any comeback. There's no higher level of appeal in any subreddit than its moderators, so don't burn your bridges with them if you are banned from a sub you might want back into at a later date.

Moderators [have guidelines](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines) to follow but bear in mind there is nobody “looking over their shoulders” to enforce mods to use them and that they are free to enforce whatever rules they wish in their Subreddits so long as they abide by [the TOU](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-october-15-2020).

* **I’m banned from a sub. Now what?**

If you see this unwelcome news in your inbox, the best thing to do is nothing in the immediate moment. Let the situation - and your emotions - cool down somewhat, then take the time to examine the sub [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) to determine what rule you have broken. Once you have done this and you still feel the decision was unfair, you should use [Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/te780w/how_to_send_a_modmail_to_the_mods_of_a_subreddit/) to appeal a Subreddit ban. Do NOT DM or private message the mod (if known) at this time. Using Modmail will ensure that all the mods of that sub will see your appeal and any subsequent replies.

* **What should I say?**

Whether you know why you were banned or are still unclear as to what happened, you need to calmly explain the situation fully, clearly and concisely. NEVER Modmail when upset despite all your outraged instincts telling you to let rip at the sudden unfair and arbitrary decision taken entirely without your consent. Likewise, don't break any sitewide rules as you can be reported to the Admins and potentially earn a sitewide ban from Reddit that is temporary or even permanent with little to no recourse.

Do take some time to reflect before writing your reply. If a mod makes the decision to ban you, there really isn’t any comeback except with that mod. There may well be other mods of that subreddit to appeal to, but it’s my experience that they very rarely overrule each other’s decisions without good reason.

There is a group of people on Reddit who will attempt to speak on your behalf, and you should read our encyclopaedia entry on [Moderation Mediation](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_moderation_mediation) to find out more. Keep in mind that they are third-party volunteers and if a mod decides they don’t want to be party to mediation, there’s nothing official that can be done.

* **This all seems a bit extreme.**

As with all things, there are usually [two sides to each story](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/pz8mkr/some_things_moderators_wish_redditors_to_know/) (as you will no doubt find out for yourself should you ever create your own subreddit) and most moderators are only looking out for the well-being of their own communities. It may not be clear to you from the outside why you received the ban, but for all you know, you might have been the hundredth person picked up that day for similar infractions.

Ultimately, it’s up to the Mods if they want to yell at, ignore the concerns of, or even ban someone for whatever reason they want. The subreddit rules are there only as guidelines to the user; they may not be the only criteria a Mod chooses if they want someone out of their sub and in any event, the Mods can ignore them as they see fit.

* **My modmail didn’t work. Now what?**

If you receive a ban from a subreddit and the moderating team won’t allow you back, I’m afraid that’s very much the end of that sub for you. You will be allowed to read and vote on submissions but unable to post or comment there anymore.

If you feel you have been unfairly treated by a moderator, [this link](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205192355-What-do-I-do-if-I-have-an-issue-with-a-moderator-) contains the official Reddit guidelines, and for for account suspensions, shadowbans etc., you can lodge an appeal with Admin at: [https://www.reddit.com/appeals](https://www.reddit.com/appeals) or [https://www.reddithelp.com/](https://www.reddithelp.com/). The Reddit FAQ has more information [https://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq).

Admins are the highest authority on Reddit but will not get involved in any disputes between Moderators and Redditors unless there’s a breach of [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) involved, in which case you can report them [here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=179106).

Making a new or Alt account for the specific purpose of circumventing a subreddit ban on Reddit isn’t allowed. This is called [Ban Evasion](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043504811-What-is-Ban-Evasion-) and is grounds for a sitewide permaban from the whole of Reddit with no recourse. Whether this is fair or unfair is not under discussion here; it’s just the way it is.

But Reddit is huge, and there may well be other subs dealing with the same topic you would be more at home in, and this is where our guide to [Navigating Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/p8t966/reddit_and_karma_explained/h9ssh6c/) might be useful to you.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

You could be meta and rail against your Reddit ban in a subreddit such as [r/ComplainToReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ComplainToReddit/), [r/justbeenbanned](https://www.reddit.com/r/justbeenbanned/), [r/modabuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/modabuse/), [r/ModsAreKillingReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModsAreKillingReddit/), [r/modsbeingdicks](https://www.reddit.com/r/modsbeingdicks/), and all the many, many similar subs. However, you should be mindful that there are subreddits that will [preemptively ban you just for posting](https://web.archive.org/web/20211126151006/https://www.reddit.com/r/banned/comments/r2pi21/banned_from_rwhitepeopletwitter_for_commenting/) in these types of subs. Have fun just reading them instead, as while reading their content with an open mind you’ll quickly realise why you shouldn’t press Send on that initial rant…

#BananasForScale
::Memes and Trends::

A banana is a common unit of measurement on Reddit. The [origin of this saying](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/banana-for-scale) isn’t from Reddit (for a change) but is mentioned here as we embraced it wholesale as our [primary definition of quantity](https://i.redd.it/zatlrt078ws81.jpg). [r/BananasForScale](https://www.reddit.com/r/BananasForScale/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

#Bandwagon Effect  
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Very simplistically, this is where people do something primarily because other people are doing it, regardless of their own beliefs which they may ignore or override. This tendency of people to blindly align their beliefs and behaviors with those of a group is also called a herd mentality, or on Reddit as the Hivemind. It’s a Reddit thing that is inexplicable but once you’ve seen it a few times it’s still inexplicable but at least you know what you’re seeing if not why. We study the problem and we’ve been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. Reddit is strange like that.

#Ban Evasion  
::Essentials for Newbies::

If you receive a ban from a subreddit and the moderating team won’t allow you back, I’m afraid that’s very much the end of that sub for you. You will be allowed to read and vote on submissions but unable to post or comment there anymore.

It is up to subreddit moderators to decide who participates on their subreddit, so even if you disagree with the reason for your ban you should not attempt to evade it. Some moderators may be okay with a user returning to their subreddit on another account so long as they agree to participate in good faith, but it is important to check this first.

Making an Alt account for the specific purpose of circumventing a subreddit ban on Reddit isn’t allowed. This is called [Ban Evasion](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043504811-What-is-Ban-Evasion-) and is grounds for a sitewide permaban from the whole of Reddit with no recourse.

[r/redditsecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) is a running log of actions taken by Reddit Admin to ensure the safety and security of Reddit, and their fundamental belief is that when a mod bans a user, they should feel confident that the person will not be able to come back and continue to harass them or their community. They [consider ban evasion to be](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/gsgg6k/improved_ban_evasion_detection_and_mitigation/) user accounts that meet either of these criteria:

1. A user is banned from a subreddit, returns on a second account, and then is reported to Admin by a moderator of the subreddit.
2. A user is banned from a subreddit, returns on a second account, and then that second account is banned from the subreddit.

They publish a quarterly Transparency Report, and if you scroll down to the “User Accounts” section of [this example](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2021-2) you’ll see that Reddit takes Ban Evasion very seriously indeed.

#Banned  
::Essentials for Newbies::

There are [several types of ban](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360003602632-Account-Status) you can get on Reddit; some more punitive than others, and some much easier to get out of than others.

If a user suspects they have been Shadowbanned, they can check their status at [r/ShadowBan](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowBan/) or [r/ShadowBanned](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowBanned/). If the answer is yes, lodge an appeal directly to Admin at [https://www.reddit.com/appeals](https://www.reddit.com/appeals). Another useful tool is [r/CommentRemovalChecker](https://www.reddit.com/r/CommentRemovalChecker/) but you must [read the rules before commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/CommentRemovalChecker/comments/9u0zes/how_to_use_what_is_this/).

There’s also a Shadowban tester here: [https://cable.ayra.ch/reddit/](https://cable.ayra.ch/reddit/)

More information about bans can be found at [https://www.reddithelp.com/](https://www.reddithelp.com/). The Reddit FAQ also has more information [https://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq).

* **Banned: Appealing a ban**

To appeal against a moderator decision, use that subreddits’ [Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/te780w/how_to_send_a_modmail_to_the_mods_of_a_subreddit/).

To appeal against a sitewide decision, lodge an appeal directly to Admin at [https://www.reddit.com/appeals](https://www.reddit.com/appeals).

I also recommend you read the [entry on **Ban**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_entry_on_**ban**) before taking action.

* **Banned: Permaban**

Permaban means permanent ban, as opposed to a normal ban which is usually temporary. A permaban from either an individual sub or the whole of Reddit is final. A moderator only has the ability to permaban from their own sub; it takes an Admin decision to permaban anyone from Reddit as a whole.

* **Banned: Shadowban**

Shadowban is the colloquial term for when Admin or the automatic spam filter removes the ability to fully use an account without your realising. A shadowbanned user’s posts and comments will continue to show up for them, but other people won’t see them except for the mods of the subreddit they post in, who will only see a ‘greyed out’ post or comment marked with a red dustbin icon. If a user is shadowbanned, any other user who tries to pull up their profile will be unsuccessful, usually getting an 'account doesn't exist' type message.

A user will not get a notification if they get Shadowbanned because this is used for spammers who are likely to create another account if their account is completely disabled; most don't notice they've been shadowbanned and will keep spamming but the site will remove everything they post or comment.

Redditors can be shadowbanned accidentally and mistakes sometimes happen. In mid 2021, the tightening of Reddit’s spam filters led to an inordinate number of [new users being instantly Shadowbanned](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/ok6906/a_note_on_shadowbans/) through no fault of their own.

Being Shadowbanned can happen for many reasons, and [here are some very useful tips on avoiding one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowBan/comments/8a2gpk/an_unofficial_guide_on_how_to_avoid_being/), as it is entirely possible to be [Shadowbanned for an entire year without realising](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-47888242).

* **Banned: Sitewide ban**

A ban from the whole of Reddit, whether temporary or permanent can only be given by Admin, who will have been briefed by a mod or mods first. Also known as [Suspended](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045734511-My-account-was-suspended-for-violating-Reddit-s-Content-Policy).

* **Banned: Subreddit Ban**

A moderator (mod) can ban you from their Subreddit for whatever reason they want. The user will get a notification if they get banned in this way. Moderators [have guidelines](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines) to follow but bear in mind that they are free to enforce whatever rules they wish in their Subreddits (so long as they comport to site-wide policies) and you need to CHECK THE SUB-SPECIFIC RULES FIRST before sending them a [Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/r/SolariaHues/comments/mz7zdp/guide_how_to_send_a_modmail_to_the_mods_of_a/).

A subreddit ban can be time-limited (temporary) or indefinite (permaban). After you are banned from a subreddit, you will still be able to read everything in that sub but no longer able to submit any posts or comments until the ban is lifted. There is no higher level of appeal in any subreddit than its moderators, so don't burn your bridges with them if you are banned from a sub you might want to return to. It can even escalate to a sitewide ban from Reddit given by the Admins that is temporary, or even permanent with little to no recourse.

#“Because you visited…”  
::Features of Reddit::

You might like to know there is a way to turn off these “because you visited this sub before” and “because you follow (sub)” posts in your feed.

Depending on the type of recommendation you are seeing, you can disable or hide them. If it's a suggested post, you can tap the three dots (...) post overflow menu located above the Join button and select "Disable recommendation" to remove these from your home feed. If it's under "Recommended for you" just tap the three dots (...) and select "show me less of this". Then, just refresh the app after disabling and they should no longer appear.

Other options to “hide” things on Reddit can be found in [https://www.reddit.com/settings/notifications](https://www.reddit.com/settings/notifications).

Unfortunately, there’s no way of getting rid of the [“Discover”](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/t0es8l/say_ahoy_to_the_discover_tab/) tab (the ‘compass’ icon) on mobile which replaced the very useful [‘Square-Circle-Square-Magnifying Glass’](https://i.redd.it/nibfggzbcd281.jpg) icon housing the Communities tab.

You might actually like to see random subreddit suggestions from time to time. Some methods of randomisation include:

* [https://www.generatormix.com/random-subreddits](https://www.generatormix.com/random-subreddits)
* [https://www.coolgenerator.com/random-subreddits-generator](https://www.coolgenerator.com/random-subreddits-generator)
* and the simple but effective [https://perchance.org/subreddits](https://perchance.org/subreddits)

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Reddit will also randomise subs for you. [r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/) and [r/popular](https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/) are the first two ports of call, but if you want to let Snoo take you somewhere new, you should visit [http://reddit.com/r/random](http://reddit.com/r/random). Adding [r/mistyfront](https://www.reddit.com/r/mistyfront/) to your feed will post random posts from random subreddits for you to enjoy, while [r/serendipity](https://www.reddit.com/r/serendipity/) is another meta-subreddit which takes a popular entry from a random subreddit and posts it for your consideration.

#Birb

This is known as the "miracle of birth," and is one of the most meaningful events in a young Redditor’s life. If you witnessed this for yourself, record the moment for posterity at [r/birthofasub](https://www.reddit.com/r/birthofasub/).

#“Blackjack and hookers”
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

“I'm going to go make my own Reddit! And it'll have blackjack... and hookers!” A phrase occasionally posted when someone is dissatisfied with a Mod ruling. Originating in [Futurama S01E02](https://youtu.be/-94qrgxH35M) where Bender is kicked out of a theme park for trying to bend the rules. Use with caution before you flounce off to make your own sub if you think the mods are being unfair. It’s Bender’s nature to bend the rules. It’s in his name. It isn’t in yours. And even if it is, don’t bend the rules. We’ll throw you out of our theme park if you do.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Good news, everyone! r/futurama celebrates the wooorld of tomorrowww! r/FuturamaWOTgame is the unofficial subreddit for the mobile game, Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow, made by TinyCo., r/Futurama_Sleepers is fer Futurama episodes and commentaries fer sleepin' to, and r/blackjackandhookers is… possibly lost.

#Blessed
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Blessed is a word widely used on social media to express gratitude for fortunate circumstances in everyday life. On Reddit, it tends to refer to pictures or comments that are cute, positive, adorable or wholesome.

Blessed humour subs include:

* r/blessedimages \- for blursed images, but just the blessed part
* r/Blessed_Images \- you know cursed images? Well, here are some blessed images
* r/blessedcomments \- the opposite of cursed comments; artistic masterpieces that fill you with joy and euphoria
* r/blessedmemes \- a sleepy sub for memes that have been blessed with beauty from what otherwise would have been chaos

This usage of the word ‘blessed’ has also given rise to the Blursed category of imagery; one that is lovely and creepy at the same time - both blessed and cursed.

#Blocking
::Essentials for Newbies::

If you’d like to cut off contact from someone for any reason, you can block them by going to their profile or visiting your user settings.  [Full instructions are here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/214548323-How-do-I-block-someone-), and if you want to know how it should work in practicality, [this will give more details](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413520308372-How-does-blocking-work-).

Reddit updated [the Blocking System](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/p2ezy4/bringing_more_visibility_to_comments_from_blocked/) in August 2021. In the previous version of blocking, some people noted that if you block someone they can still go around responding to your comments and you would never know. It isn’t greatly different now, and in some ways has made things worse for some people.  [Here’s an explanation of the new system](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/s71g03/announcing_blocking_updates/).

When someone blocks you, you are prevented from replying to any comments underneath a comment by that person. You will just see the message *"Something is broken, please try again later."* As a result, it’s possible to be in a comment chain where someone has replied then immediately blocked you. That prevents you from challenging what they reply to you and also prevents you from replying to **anyone else who replies to you** if the person who blocked you also has a comment above yours in the chain. Everyone else can see and interact with what they said, just not you. It is now essentially a tool that anyone can use to exclude people with differing views from any discussions they initiate.

To put it bluntly, you’re basically blocking yourself and your ability to respond, not the user who provoked you in the first place.

In the end, Reddit is still the internet. Idiots will troll you. Don't feed the trolls. Ignore them, downvote them and move on. They'll soon lose interest and go away to find someone who is naïve enough to engage with them. Don’t let that be you.

If you wish to access the list of users you have blocked on Reddit, desktop users can go to the “Safety and Privacy” section from the User Settings menu. You can find the “User Settings” option in the drop-down menu of your profile. On the mobile app, tap your profile picture at the [top right corner of the screen](https://i.redd.it/ox0xqepzzvt81.jpg) (it’s on the top-left corner on Android) to open up the three dots “hamburger” Post Overflow menu. At the very bottom of the hamburger menu, tap the “Settings” option to bring up [this menu](https://i.redd.it/svjcg2y60wt81.png). Tap your username at the top of the page to bring up [“Account Settings”](https://i.redd.it/5r3l96ls9yt81.jpg). From here, go to the “Manage blocked accounts” section under “Blocking and Permissions”.

You might wish to unblock someone, in which case here’s the instructions for [Unblocking](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043035252-How-do-I-unblock-someone-). Alternatively, if you accidentally block a user, or decide that a user no longer needs to be blocked, you can remove them from your blocked users via [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/friends](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/friends).

#Blurred Images
::General Guides::

Sometimes you might see an image post where the picture is blurred out. This is called “safe browsing mode” and is usually because the picture is NSFW. Clicking the image should unblur it. If you want to turn this mode off or on, you need to adjust your NSFW settings.

At [https://new.reddit.com/settings/feed](https://new.reddit.com/settings/feed) you can choose to see NSFW content or not, and if you choose to see it, you can also choose to blur it with safe browsing mode on the Feed Settings page.

On the iOS app, NSFW settings can be found in your **device settings** page after selecting the Reddit app, and NOT the Reddit app itself. You'll want to enable "Show NSFW Content (18+)" and disable "Blur NSFW Images".

Another way to view NSFW content in the Reddit app on iOS is to follow these steps on desktop or a browser:

1. Visit [https://old.reddit.com/prefs/](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/)
2. (Log in, if you aren't already.)
3. Turn on the option ‘I am over eighteen years old and willing to view adult content’, scroll down to the bottom, and click the \[save options\] button.
4. Turn on the option ‘include not safe for work (NSFW) search results in searches’, scroll down to the bottom, and click the \[save options\] button.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/blurrypicturesofdogs specialises in those photos you were trying to take of your dog but they had no intention of staying still for it. Every post must be titled "blurry picture of (a) dog(s)". Likewise, r/blurrypicturesofcats collects photos of our feline friends objecting to being photographed. Here, every post is titled "blurry picture of (a) cat(s)".

#”Blursed”
::Jargon and Slang::

Blursed is an adjective that means "blessed and cursed", mostly used to describe images that both delight and disgust the viewer at the same time.

On Reddit, users often say images that delight them [such as a picture of a cute puppy](https://www.reddit.com/r/blessedimages/comments/srmy0s/blessed_puppy/) are Blessed, and images that disgust or disturb them [such as a picture of a child being followed by a man in a knockoff Barney the Dinosaur costume](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cursed_Images/comments/p3o0d6/cursed_barney/) are Cursed. Blursed images are both blessed and cursed - they [simultaneously delight and disturb](https://www.reddit.com/r/blursedimages/comments/e9mush/blursed_replica/) the viewer.

Blursed humour subs include:

* r/Blursed \- an NSFW sub to find and share blursed images
* r/blursedimages \- home of the most blursed images on the internet
* r/Blursedcomments \- for comments that are blessed and cursed
* r/blursed_memes \- for memes that are both blessed and cursed

As always, you must read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) of these subreddits carefully before you contribute.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Hmmm refers to a subsection of Reddit focused on bizarre photographs purposely taken out of context, and comes in three flavours:

* r/hmm \- for things that make you go hmm
* r/hmmm \- who regard the Internet as an art
* r/hmmmm \- for hmmmy pictures but everything here is original

#Boneappletea
::Jargon and Slang::

“Like when the food hella good, you say bone apple tea, it's like french or some shit.” r/Boneappletea is a link posted on seeing a malapropism - the mistaken use of an incorrect but real word in place of a similar-sounding real word, resulting in a nonsensical, sometimes humorous utterance. Originating from worldstarhiphop and the Urban Dictionary.

Be careful posting this link; make sure it isn’t a r/BoneAppleTypo first. This is a sub where the rules are tightly enforced. If you want to submit something there, browse to get a feel of the place, read the rules in the Sidebar (on mobile this will be the About tab, Menu tab and Community Info found in the three dot “hamburger” menu top RH corner of your screen), any Pinned posts (these will have a lime green ‘pin’ icon on the top corner and will show on top when you sort the Subreddit by ‘Hot’) and Wiki (where there is one). Bon Appétit!

#BoneAppleTypo
::Jargon and Slang::

A link often posted when a misspelling is especially hilarious. People can't spell; Reddit makes fun of them. This sub is less restrictive than r/Boneappletea and if they remove a post for any part of their Rule 1, it’s usually welcomed here. This includes names, homonyms, misspellings, and words that don't sound anything like the original. r/BoneAppleTypo.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/excgarated is for when a misspelling is so bad it's comical, potentially to the extent of being unique in the universe. r/typo used to be a place for funny grammatical screw-ups and needs reviving, as does r/FunnyTypos.

#bonehealingjuice
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A link or phrase used when someone takes a meme template and gives it a literal meaning. r/bonehealingjuice is wholesome bone healing where all content should be straightforward or deadpan versions of meme formats.  r/bonehealingjuice. Opposite to r/boneachingjuice.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

This is just one of Reddit’s [“Anti-Jokes” subreddits](https://i.redd.it/bo92r68eqos81.png). Anti-Jokes are funny because they make you expect a joke but instead you receive reality or something far more bizarre than anticipated, but in a clever or humorous way.  r/antimeme is the place to set up jokes that have no punchline as is r/AntiMemes. Edit the text of an image to create a new phrase at r/SpeedOfLobsters. While Anti-Jokes have mundane, run-of-the-mill punchlines, the submissions at r/AntiAntiJokes have absurd, ridiculous, nonsensical punchlines.  r/AntiJokes was closed for a while but now lives again under new moderation.

Originally specific to cute animal subs, now with wider Reddit usage. [A light tap on the nose](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/pugid5/boop/).

#Bots
::Features of Reddit::

Bots are scripts written by users and can be the boon or the bane of every Redditors’ life. Popping up unsummoned and often when you least expect it, Bots can be:

* useful (e.g. u/Reddit-Book-Bot)
* funny (e.g. u/phonebatterylevelbot)
* clever (e.g. u/alphabet_order_bot)
* very clever (e.g. u/Haikusbot)
* analytical (e.g. u/same_post_bot)
* downright annoying (e.g. u/I-Am-Dad-Bot in all its many reincarnations)
* intentionally misleading (e.g. u/Not_RepostSleuthBot)
* very informative (e.g. u/reply-guy-bot who reports on [plagiarised comments](https://www.reddit.com/user/reply-guy-bot/comments/n9fpva/faq/) made by spambots trying to acquire karma)

All bots respond to [specific words or phrases in a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/66w1tu/how_do_reddit_bots_actually_work_and_how_do_i/) and you should reply to any bot comment by saying either **Good Bot** or **Bad Bot** as u/GoodBot_BadBot/ collates the replies and ranks the bots accordingly.

Subreddits aren’t totally [at the mercy of Bots](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/e183pt/announcing_an_improved_defender_of_subreddits/) as Mods will often ban them from their subs if they find them annoying, and r/BotDefense basically does what it says: defends against bots. Some subs also use r/BotTerminator as well.

Some Bots can be used by Redditors. These are known as Service Bots and will usually respond to user mentions for a specific purpose. Some examples which you can summon by mentioning their username in the comments of a post are:

* u/risbot \- If you see an image on Reddit that you’re sure you’ve seen before, this bot will perform a Google reverse image search in seconds. Essential for mobile app users.
* u/goodreads-bot \- You don’t need to call this one by name. In r/booksuggestions, this bot will give a brief description of a book by typing: {Book Title} or a longer one by this: {{Book Title}} which gives a [short synopsis of the book](https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/pyu2xo/comment/hf7d81b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). You can also use the author name like this: {Book Title by Some Author} or {{Book Title by Some Author}}.
* u/RepostSleuthBot \- This is a high performance repost detection bot you can summon if you see a post you think you’ve seen on Reddit before.  r/RepostSleuthBot.
* u/RemindMeBot \- This bot lets you set a reminder for a certain amount of time via a comment or private message, and then sends you a reminder message at your targeted time. Use it if you want to check back on a post for updates, or remember to do something a week from now. You’ll need instructions [but they are easy to follow](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/). More information at r/RemindMeBot.
* u/stabbot \- This bot stabilizes videos, uploads the result and replies to your comment when summoned. If you want your result also to be cropped, mention /u/stabbot_cropinstead.  r/stabbot.
* u/redditspeedbot \- This is one for speeding up or slowing down videos, [and to use it](https://www.reddit.com/user/redditspeedbot/comments/eqdo8u/redditspeedbot_guide/) just comment u/redditspeedbot <speed> on a post that has a video or GIF.
* u/GifReversingBot \- Look at things in reverse! [This bot is fun](https://www.reddit.com/user/GifReversingBot/comments/9gbzyu/how_to_use_gifreversingbot/).
* u/profanitycounter \- Do you suspect someone of having a potty mouth?  [This is the bot to use to check](https://www.reddit.com/user/profanitycounter)!
* u/user_simulator \- another fun bot which will scan all of a user's available comments (up to 1000 or so) and build a new comment based on them. It can also simulate whole subreddits at once! r/User_Simulator.
* u/InactiveUserDetector \- this one looks for username mentions, and will point out if that user hasn’t been active on Reddit for some time.

There is no official list of Reddit bots, but r/redditbots and [this old list](https://reddit.com/r/autowikibot/w/redditbots) or even [this link](https://ada-young.com/pastebin/40ARHwr6) will give you some idea of what’s lurking in wait. More than 61000+ Bots can be seen here [https://botrank.pastimes.eu/](https://botrank.pastimes.eu/) but not all of them will be currently active. There is no definitive list of Service bots on Reddit either, but questions and information can be found at r/botwatch.

We also have another type of bot that roams Reddit: [the Spambot](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/bots/what-is-a-spambot/). Unlike any of the benign bots mentioned above, these are bad news. They have their own entry in this encyclopaedia as you need to know [how to spot them](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/5fcz3m/there_is_so_much_spam_on_reddit_how_can_we/).

Going back to the harmless but sometimes annoying bot variety, please forgive me but I just have to mention some bots that were very divisive and, some I believe now mercifully defunct. u/uwuwizard and u/uwutranslator, which did exactly that, and if that wasn’t bad enough, a bot that when you replied to a comment with [!emojify](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/jdru0x/reddits_current_state_of_mind_on_the_emoji_bot/) it sent a bot over that replied again but with all the words having an emoji attached to them. I mention these because defunct bots have a tendency to return. Don’t say I told you to try them and see because I’m not telling you that. At all.

If any bot annoys you to the point you never wish to see them again, you can Block them just like any other user.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/BotsScrewingUp is a sub to document those times that although we have [Bottiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/bottiquette), bots sometimes get things very, very wrong.

#Brandolini's Law
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Brandolini's Law (also known as the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle) is a saying, commonly known as an “Internet Adage”, made by Italian programmer [Alberto Brandolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini's_law) in 2013. The law states: "The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude larger than to produce it." This adage emphasises the [difficulty of debunking](https://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingScience/comments/5hmazr/brandolinis_law_the_amount_of_energy_needed_to/) false, facetious, or otherwise misleading information.

You can find confirmation bias for any ridiculous thought that pops in your head on the internet, and on Reddit you need look no further than some of the conspiracy subreddits to see this in its fullest glory.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/IsItBullshit asks just that, r/bullshit is just that, and r/quityourbullshit calls it out with proof. r/TopMindsOfReddit collects posts directly involving a conspiracy theory, conspiracy theorists, or denial of objective reality on Reddit.  r/TheTopMinds is a place to enjoy and laugh at far-fetched conspiracy theories and the Top Minds that believe them from all over the internet. r/ShitRedditSays claim that “Free speech is a disease and we are the cure” and r/worstof proves it's not all roses and sunshine here on Reddit, though r/Negareddit has to be the most meta sub for discussion of Reddit’s failings.

#Brigading
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Sending or inviting Redditors to go to another sub for the purposes of making mischief, manipulating voting scores, or causing a ruckus is considered to be “Brigading”. This is a serious offence on Reddit and comes in various forms, all of which are damaging to the community in general and therefore taken very seriously by both mods and admin. Reddit as a whole has [just eight rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), and “no Brigading” is dealt with in rule 2 and to a lesser extent in rule 1.

A very simple form of Brigading would be entering a “pro” sub with the sole intention of being “anti”. So, somebody in the sub r/ifindsomefoodstuffsdisgusting might say something to the effect of “I’m not a fan of mayonnaise at all”. This post is read by a member of r/webelievemayoisthegreatestfoodstuffever and in a huff, posts a link to it, sending outraged mayo lovers over to contest a perfectly reasonable comment about mayo hating in a sub designed for such an opinion. If you really have such strong feelings about mayo that you need to let out (I know I do), there will definitely be more suitable places for them on Reddit than trying to incite any subreddit drama between communities.

* **What is “Brigading”, really?**

A term that originated on Reddit, [Brigading](https://institute.global/policy/social-media-futures-what-brigading) is when a group of users, generally outsiders to the targeted subreddit, "invade" a specific subreddit and flood it with downvotes in order to damage karma dynamics on the targeted sub; spam the sub with posts and comments to further their own agenda; or perform other coordinated abusive behaviour such as insulting or harassing the subreddit’s users in order to troll, manipulate, or interfere with the targeted community.

While the term often refers to an attack that is intentionally orchestrated by the "brigade" whose members consist of separate people, it's also sometimes used to refer to [Sock Puppet](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/7/#wiki_sock_puppet)tactics, in which people create extra user accounts for the purpose of acquiring more voting power (this in particular is very very much against Reddit rules), or simply an unplanned circlejerk of downvotes against a particular user or community.

Individual users can also be targeted by a downvote brigade in certain situations; i.e. if a person is following you around Reddit with the express intention of downvoting, negatively commenting or generally harassing you in subs they wouldn’t normally participate in. However, individual brigades like this are hard to prove and best ignored, as every user can only vote once on each post or comment and vote fuzzing can make these scores fluctuate in real-time in any event.

* **What does Reddit do about it?**

It’s long been said that admins (Reddit employees) keep server logs that show what [subreddits people are coming from when they brigade](https://www.reddit.com/r/gloriouspcmasterrace/comments/1r01ny/glorious_masterrace_hear_me/cdih50a/?context=2), so if you suspect a community of Brigading, report it with a message here: [https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

It’s also helpful if you include links to any posts, comments, or messages that led you to believe the community is coordinating a brigade. The admins will be able to see them even if it's a private subreddit. You should also note that because they’re too easy to manipulate, Reddit don’t accept screenshots. Here’s another relevant help centre page: [https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058311612-How-do-I-report-a-community-](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058311612-How-do-I-report-a-community-), and our general guide to reporting is here: [https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008810132-Reporting](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008810132-Reporting).

* **Can it be prevented?**

Mods can shut down any brigading posts on their subreddit, but cannot stop their members from creating other accounts to spam. Some subreddits accept crossposts from other subreddits in order to discuss them in a different environment, but usually impose a "do not comment in linked threads" rule. On “Old Reddit” some subs would use certain url prefixes to enforce this rule. The most well known one is [https://np.reddit.com](https://np.reddit.com/), which a lot of subreddits used for a "no participation" mode, and you [can read more about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoParticipation/wiki/intro).

Mods [have guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/lhel8m/comment/gmwtpfn/) on dealing with Brigading, and mod teams are increasingly looking at other ways of preemptively stopping brigades from happening in the first place as the problem [grows larger](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/d8cfoe/what_can_be_done_about_a_serious_brigading_issue/).

For just one example, animal subreddits can attract those with polarised views of some specific cat and dog types, including munchkin and pitbull, and sometimes [posting an innocent picture of an animal](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/58mhyl/pit_bull_drama_in_raww_lots_of_it/) can prompt unexpected and potentially unpleasant responses. To stop this happening in the first place, some mods have decided to [preemptively ban members of other subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/tsu5zv/why_is_brigading_such_a_bad_thing/) as a “just in case” measure.

In another recent example, mods took [more drastic action](https://mashable.com/article/antiwork-subreddit-fox-news-interview), temporarily closing their sub after [an interview didn’t go as planned](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/sdesxw/megathread_rantiwork_goes_private_after_fox_news/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/OutOfTheLoop is an incredibly useful subreddit to help you keep up to date with what's going on with Reddit and other stuff, while r/SubredditDrama is the place where people can come and talk about Reddit fights and other dramatic happenings from other subreddits. And r/TwentyCharacterLimit is often the reply to when someone posts an obviously fake sub name that's too long to be a subreddit.

#Cakeday
::Essentials for Newbies::

When a person loves Reddit very much, they make an account. Cakeday is an annual celebration of that love! Your Reddit Birthday, sometimes also known as your Redditversary and even [“Spotify Blue Cheese day”](https://i.redd.it/dlsd9n22hx331.jpg), your Cakeday happens every year on the anniversary you created [your Reddit account](https://www.reddit.com/r/cakeday/comments/221qra/how_to_and_what_is_cakeday_and_what_to_expect_on/) and has nothing to do with your RL birthday (which Reddit doesn’t know).

Your Cakeday is shown on your Profile and can also be found on [http://www.redditcakeday.com](http://www.redditcakeday.com/)or [https://www.cakeday.fun](https://www.cakeday.fun/). There’s even an independent site called [http://www.cakedayreminder.com](http://www.cakedayreminder.com/) which will send you an email when your Reddit cakeday is coming up.

On the day itself, you will get an icon showing a little slice of cake [next to your username](https://i.redd.it/rqkfvyavkeu81.jpg) for the day (it may look slightly different [depending on the platform](https://i.imgur.com/HDjPV8l.png) you’re using) and the [Age Trophy on your profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrophyWiki/comments/kftv4h/reddit_trophy_xyear_club/) will go up one number. You can see on the link that the perceptive Redditor u/DarthEquus deduced that the Reddit anniversary trophy icons are all based on the themes for actual anniversary gifts: paper, cotton, leather, linen, wood, iron, copper, bronze, pottery, tin/aluminium, steel, silk, lace, gold, crystals.

The cake icon was changed in 2020 from its [original appearance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/iig17b/i_baked_a_reddit_cake_on_my_cake_day/) to now resemble a tasty looking [slice of gateau](https://www.reddit.com/r/cakeday/comments/1p4chj/i_photoshopped_a_piece_of_cake_to_match_the/).

It is customary in most subreddits to say “Happy Cakeday!” whenever you see the cake icon next to a username whether you know the Redditor or not. Do this with caution; some of the more serious or restrictive subs will class this as “unnecessary clutter”. However, there’s also a button on some versions of Reddit that you can press to say “Happy Cake Day” to the Redditor in private. Do it! It’s a Reddit Thing to do. The usual response is “Thank you, Kind Redditor.” Reddit loves rituals.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

You can even legitimately ask for Karma on this day in r/cakeday and r/Spotifycheese. You might not get any, but it’s fun trying.

#“Came here to say this.”
::Jargon and Slang::

A phrase used to indicate someone else in the comments said something you wanted to say, whether it be a joke, a reference or an observation. Often downvoted so use with caution as a phrase on its own.  [However, it can sometimes prompt a Comment Chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/b8h9uv/why_do_people_comment_came_here_to_say_this/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/CameHereToSayThis is where you go to say This.  r/ThisButUnironically is a subreddit for when someone posts something obviously sarcastic but you actually agree with it, and r/SelfAwarewolves are people who unknowingly describe themselves in their rantings. r/thisis…. well…. that?  r/thisisntwhoweare is for the times when someone gets caught doing something wrong, and during their 'Mea Culpa' they utter the most ridiculous phrase ever... "This isn't me" or "This is not who I am", while r/thisismylifenow is a subreddit with gifs or pics of people and animals accepting their uncommon situations, and r/Thisismylifemeow is for when you just accept your new life as a feline.

#Cat. or cat.
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

One-word replies are often seen as low-quality and often frowned upon in Reddit. Yet sometimes you will see huge one-word comment chains saying "cat", some with many upvotes.

In the subreddit r/catsstandingup, you're only allowed to comment "Cat." So, naturally, whenever a post or picture features a cat, posting "Cat." carried over to the rest of Reddit. It’s important to note here that in r/catsstandingup, the C in “Cat.” is [capitalised](https://i.redd.it/0zlt2md50hu81.jpg), whereas in r/catssittingdown, the C in “cat.” is [lower case](https://i.redd.it/ak6meey70hu81.jpg). Subreddit or social experiment? The answer is always: Cat. or cat.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/kitty is a sub where you’re only allowed to comment “Kitty.” and all posts in r/MEOW_IRLshould be titled “MEOW\_IRL”.

#Cat tax
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

It is virtually mandatory on Reddit that if the story you’re telling involves a cat or dog, a Cat Tax is required; i.e. you need to post or link a picture of said cat or dog. If you don’t have one, any random cat or dog picture from the internet will suffice, so long as you say that’s what it is and don’t try to pass it off as your own. Despite the name, this tax doesn’t just apply to cats and dogs; most animals have been required for taxation at some time or another. Obligatory [Llama tax (random llamas, not my own)](https://youtu.be/f95cHmw_6Sk).

---

#Cats
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Everyone knows [cats rule the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_and_the_Internet). Their takeover started last century (I’ll never get tired of saying that!) with the rise of online chatrooms and, as you would expect, has infiltrated Reddit to enormous success. Nobody seems to [know exactly why](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jordanshapiro/2012/12/07/cats-on-the-internet-a-psychological-explanation/) cats took over and [not dogs](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/16/why-internet-loves-cats-not-dogs) although there are many [interesting theories](https://gizmodo.com/why-cats-rule-the-internet-instead-of-dogs-1728316152) on this matter.

It has long been rumoured that Reddit admin can easily [be distracted by cat pics](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/l79z3q/comment/gl5m6dw/); use cat pics [to deflect from the matter at hand](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/fh1s0m/yelling_into_the_void_aka_a_modmail_bug_that_may/fk8pke6/?context=999), or are even [secretly cats themselves](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/rbrey6/reddit_recap_2021/hnpr39j/?context=999).

Ten years ago, Reddit even helped propel a user’s cat into the realm of worldwide celebrity. [Grumpy Cat](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/10bu17/meet_grumpy_cat/) became world famous after first appearing on two glorious [posts on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/10cfbf/since_everyone_liked_grumpy_cat_here_are_a_few/) in 2012 before she sadly [passed away in 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/bpozxa/the_iconic_grumpy_cat_has_passed_away_today/). Her memory and memes live on at r/GrumpyCat.

There are too many dedicated Cat Meme subs of varying quality to list here, but a good start would be:

* r/Catmemes
* r/CryingCatMemes
* r/lolcats

r/Catsubs maintain a comprehensive list of [cat subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catsubs/wiki/index) but it will never be complete because there are [never enough cat subs](https://www.ranker.com/list/best-cat-subreddits/amylindorff), leading the intrepid Redditor u/GetOffMyLawn_ to attempt the brave undertaking of [another list of cat subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetOffMyLawn_/comments/tla7vh/cat_subs/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/ifuckinghatecats and r/fuckcats are places for those who don't like cats, and are best avoided if you do like cats.

#Celebrity Redditors
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Reddit is about the content not the people, and because of this, you'll be freshly judged by what you say every single time you post or comment. Reddit-centric celebrities are therefore few and far between, but like everything there are always exceptions, and here are some Redditors you may encounter on your travels:

* [u/*demetri*](https://www.reddit.com/user/_demetri_/) A Redditor with a proclivity for posting really, really, REALLY long surreal comments, often collected at r/DemetriStrikesAgain
* u/Poem_for_your_sprog One of Reddit’s Spontaneous Rhymers with [an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3aungz/hi_im_sam_garland_aka_upoem_for_your_sprog_ive/) and two subs : r/Poem_for_your_sprog and r/ilikthebred to [write your own rhymes in the same style](https://www.reddit.com/r/ilikthebred/comments/84lkuj/how_to_write_a_good_i_lik_the_bred_poem/).
* u/SchnoodleDoodleDo Another of Reddit’s Spontaneous Rhymers, also to be found on r/ilikthebred.
* u/shittymorph A Redditor adept in the ways of Bait-and-Switch Copypasta [ending always with](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/q81u9l/you_are_looking_the_first_image_of_another_solar/hgmrhym/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) “In nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.” Invoke this user whenever you see this phrase in the wild or document it at r/shittymorph.
* u/Shitty_Watercolour A Redditor who makes whimsical watercolour paintings. Has a sub r/Shitty_Watercolour.

There are definitely more Reddit celebs given mention throughout this encyclopaedia. I may well add more here on future revisions.

**See Also:**

#Chat
::Essentials for Newbies::

A form of private messaging on Reddit (the speech bubble icon). Chat, Direct (private) Messaging, and Following are restricted on new accounts on Reddit in an effort to reduce spam, scams, and other bad faith uses of the platform. It's not public knowledge exactly what the limitations are, but typically after a few days you can start to use these features.

Major changes to chat came into force in late 2021 which you [can read about here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/pu4p6p/now_you_can_share_images_and_use_slash_commands/). This link gives an illustrated guide to sharing images via chat, and details on how to use [slash commands](https://reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406251471892) \- a fast way to complete chat related actions directly from the input bar. The main official help page for chat [is here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008805652-Chat).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Sometimes, we just want someone to chat to.  r/Needafriend is a subreddit for people looking to make friends from all over the world to chat, discuss and share in a supportive manner, and r/CasualConversation is another good place to find people who just need someone to talk to. They maintain a [directory](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/directory) of other places to chat or talk, including r/SeriousConversation for in-depth discussions, theories or opinions.

#Chat Posts
::Essentials for Newbies::

Chat Posts are like regular Reddit posts, but displayed in a live chat view instead. This is a successor to the short-lived [community chat rooms](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/one-to-one-and-subreddit-chat-its-finally-here) which were phased out in [late 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/jwme40/deprecating_community_chat_rooms/).

#Chevrons
::General Guides::

Chevrons are supposed to help you skip child comments on a long post by jumping to the next parent comment. It might be mobile or even iOS only. However, sometimes they get in the way on a small screen but the good news is that you can move them to wherever you want on the screen by holding them down and then sliding.

On iOS they appear as two little chevrons, which look like [these on the lower far right](https://i.redd.it/s11nr8qgkei81.png) but they embiggen when you press and hold [to move them wherever you want](https://i.redd.it/ogawycyjkei81.png). Let go to “park” them, and the icon will smallify again. This is only temporary, and they’ll appear in the default position again on the next post you go to.

#chrissimpsonsartist
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Chris (Simpsons Artist) is an illustrator known for his bizarre, naïve art-style depictions of characters from various cartoons, live-action television series and films. Mentioned here because pictures from his book “The Story of Life” are often erroneously found on r/badwomensanatomy, and sometimes at r/NotHowGirlsWork. A subreddit dedicated to the glorious creations of chris (simpsons artist) can be found at r/chrissimpsonsartist.

#Chonker
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

An animal that is larger than it should be; [usually a cat](https://youtu.be/TsHrJM1AExc). Using this word (or the shorter “Chonk”) as a term of endearment about an overweight animal is actually a [contentious issue on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/b8aykd/is_referring_to_overweight_animals_as_chonkers/). r/Chonkers is a subreddit for posting pictures or memes involving chubby cats, along with a disclaimer that they don’t wish to promote cat obesity, and have links in their sidebar about cat health and weight loss.  r/Delightfullychubby accepts other animals too but is still mostly cats.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/chonkerhate is a sub who clearly don’t agree with the trend of glorifying obese and overweight animals, and a user [made a guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/chonkerhate/comments/leyxig/low_quality_comparison_of_fluffy_and_actually/) to show the difference between glorious chub and horrendous fat.

#Christmas on Reddit
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

As you would imagine, Christmas is a special time on Reddit, and nearer the time you might see some of your favourite subreddits changing their theme to suit, and at one time there were even seasonal awards being added to the Awards list. But as subreddits are for life, not just for Christmas, subs that are there all year long which really come into the fore this season are:

* r/AllThingsXmas
* r/christmas
* r/ChristmasDecorating
* r/ChristmasLights
* r/ChristmasCats
* r/ChristmasMusic
* r/ChristmasTrees
* r/ChristmasBathroom
* r/FestiveNaturalNOEL

We also have r/ukchristmas especially relating to UK Christmas traditions, gifts, food, music and celebrations; r/December for stuff relating to the last month of the year, and if you want to watch some holiday movies with others online while communicating through live chat posts, r/Movie_Club is the place for you!

* **A Christmas Assortment, old and new**

r/charlesdickens discuss all things related to Charles Dickens and a popular topic is his famous creation, [Scrooge](https://www.reddit.com/r/charlesdickens/search/?q=%20Scrooge&restrict_sr=1&sr_nsfw=).

r/ChristmasCarol is a new sub for those who love Dickens’ classic tale 'A Christmas Carol' to get together and discuss the book and its numerous adaptations for stage and screen.

r/AskScienceFiction tried to work out just [how wealthy Scrooge was](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/7ha8pk/a_christmas_carol_just_how_wealthy_is_scrooge/).

r/AskHistorians enter into the spirit with a [History of the Yule Holiday](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/k0h3au/history_of_the_yule_holiday/).

r/NoStupidQuestions sensibly discover [why people call it “Xmas”](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/7k6z4z/why_do_people_call_it_xmas/).

r/Damnthatsinteresting show how [Candy Canes are made](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/r1qhbq/making_candy_canes/).

r/movies had a discussion about [awful Christmas movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/rr82pg/the_normalizing_of_horrible_christmas_movies_must/).

[The Christmas Price Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Price_Index) is a tongue-in-cheek economic indicator, tracking the cost of buying the items in the Christmas Carol “The Twelve Days of Christmas”.

r/WHITE is for content related to shades of the colour White.

r/adventofcode is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

r/ChristmasGhosts is a holly-bound compendium of short stories, video, non-fiction, poetry, and song, with emphasis on the supernatural. For more spooky stuff, see the entry on [Halloween](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/4/#wiki_halloween).

Keep in mind that, like [emojis](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_emojis), not everyone will be as enthusiastic about your new find as you may be.

* **Bah, humbug.**

Not everyone in the world loves Christmas. The good folks at r/Creepmas are upset at the continuing intrusion of Christmas on Halloween and celebrate by putting a spooky twist on all things Christmas during the first 13 days of December, while r/ChristmasTooEarly is a new sub about people putting up decorations or retailers selling Christmas goods too early. Mock traditional Christmas themes and tropes at r/ChristmasMemes while outright Christmas haters are invited to take refuge at: r/ihatechristmas.

Meanwhile, the “War on Christmas” [might well be fake](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/ea1wc0/the_war_on_christmas_is_fake/) but is well documented at the small sub r/WaronChristmas. In the meantime, [here’s a list of movies](https://lifehacker.com/10-movies-to-watch-if-you-hate-christmas-1848158906) to watch if you hate Christmas.

* **It’s the most wonderful time of the year?**

While our TV and other advertising bombards us with warm nostalgic images of lovely times past, tables groaning with every foodstuff imaginable or large, happy families having fun together, it is important to remember this is not everyone’s reality, and those living with a different experience might find our feature on [“Relationship and Advice Subreddits”](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/6/#wiki_.201Crelationship_and_advice_subreddits.201D) useful.

For many people, this will be their first holiday season without that special loved one, or yet another one in some form of lockdown or where travel restrictions mean they’re alone. Please be extra aware of those acquaintances and neighbours for whom the smallest extra kindness will make all the difference to their lives at this time.

Finance is a subject at the front of everyone’s concerns at this time of year, and r/Frugalcontains plenty of hints and tips for making the [most of your resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/dtg59o/very_tight_budget_for_christmas/), including a Sidebar (About tab on mobile) and drop-down Menus of links to many other relevant subreddits.

r/StressFreeSeason is a place to go for all your holiday needs and information, crafts, tips, money saving advice, and resources local to you. Their sister subreddit r/stressfreexmas is a place to make material requests for Christmas. IT IS VITAL to read their rules, found in their Wiki, Sidebar and Pinned Post, and if you are considering signing up, you might also find [“Financial Help on Reddit”](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/4/#wiki_.201Cfinancial_help_on_reddit.201D) useful.

r/SantasLittleHelpers is billed as “the happiest place on Reddit” and it doesn’t take much scrolling to see why. Every year they pool together their resources to provide a Christmas for thousands of people who may not otherwise have one. Families who are struggling to give each other a joyful Christmas can sign up to make a request, and generous givers can spread the joy of Christmas all over the world. Again, the details in their menu bar are essential reading if you wish to take part.

* **In the bleak midwinter…**

For some eyebleach of nature at its finest, we have:

* r/FreezingFuckingCold
* r/Icicles
* r/snow
* r/snowing
* r/Winterwx
* r/Winter

And if you’re going out, r/skiing is for the sport where you strap two boards to your feet and point them down the mountain, as is r/ski, while the folks at r/xcountryskiing are dedicated to cross-country skiing. For all things snowboarding, r/snowboarding or "shreddit" is the home for shredders of all ages, cultures, and abilities and r/snowboardingnoobs is for noob snowboarders, or snowboarders that just want to ask noob questions.

Other winter sports are available, such as:

* r/wintercycling
* r/FigureSkating
* r/iceskating

If real snow doesn’t cut it for you, r/ImaginaryWinterscapes surely will.

* **The “reason for the season”**

Religion is obviously associated with this time of year, and r/religion has [a superb Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/wiki/index) which gives a basic overview of many popular religions, philosophies and schools of thought.

A good start to find similar subreddits is this [old but still useful list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReligionHub/comments/kohy3/directory_of_religionrelated_subreddits/) and here’s a good list of subreddits concerning many aspects of [Philosophy, Religion and Spirituality](https://www.findareddit.com/category/philosophy-religion-and-spirituality) for many kinds of belief systems - including none. Even if you’re not religiously inclined, [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/how-christmas-has-evolved-over-centuries) have a fascinating history of the Christmas holiday.

Always read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) before commenting or posting on an unfamiliar Subreddit.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/IceChewersAnonymous isn’t particularly seasonal but deserves a mention as I honestly thought I was the only weirdo who did this ever, for years. When I was a child, the only time I ever got ice in my drink was when we went out for meals over the holiday season so it’s forever associated to me.

#Circlejerk
::Jargon and Slang::

A situation in which a group of people engage in self-indulgent or self-gratifying behaviour, especially by reinforcing each other's views or attitudes. They’ll have similar beliefs that self-validate each other, suppress opposing opinions, do not consider that alternate opinions exist, or consider themselves, their opinion, or their group exclusive/superior. ELI5 tried to [define it](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/n4nni/eli5_the_meaning_of_circlejerk_as_in_rcirclejerk/)some time ago, and some users talked about the origins of the phrase.

r/circlejerk is a subreddit that considers the majority of Reddit to be a circlejerk because Reddit loves being meta. Here’s a simple recipe for a classic circlejerk:

* Someone posts an ill-informed, pseudo-intellectual but popular opinion about any academic subject: quantum mechanics, literary history, etc. Upvotes begin.
* Someone else with expertise in the subject area replies in a calm, measured way, without pulling the r/iamverysmart card (however well-warranted it may be) correcting the misunderstanding, usually with multiple citations.
* Massive downvotes and copypasta against the reply - 'OMFG don't be a gatekeeper', 'iamverysmart', 'check your privilege', etc. - and more upvotes for the poor maligned OP.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/bookscirclejerk makes fun of stupid posts in other subs about books; r/writingcirclejerkparodies writing communities; r/fitnesscirclejerk states “if you've got the time to jerk, you've got the time to twerk” and r/vegancirclejerk is strictly for The Morally Superior Vegan. Revel in r/moviescirclejerk reinventing [art-house classic Japanese movies as Marvel blockbusters](https://www.reddit.com/r/moviescirclejerk/comments/qtc7i9/criterion_presents_phase_two_of_the_kcu_kurosawa/) and if that isn’t enough for you, [this list surely will be](https://www.reddit.com/r/ofcoursethatsathing/comments/51ubpx/sobravenet_a_master_list_of_all_circlejerk/).

#CMV
::Jargon and Slang::

“Change My View”. Originally sub specific from r/changemyview, now with wider Reddit usage. Describes when you are open to hearing opinions to persuade or change your mind. r/changemyview is a sub to post an opinion you accept may be flawed in an effort to understand other perspectives on the issue. Enter with a mindset for conversation, not debate.

They have very strict [rules on posting format](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules) and a unique reward system for contributors. Any user, whether they're the OP or not, should reply to a comment that changed their view with a delta symbol (∆) and an explanation of the change. Instructions on [this delta system](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem/) can be found in their sidebar.  r/changemyview.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Got a burning unpopular opinion you want to share? Spark some heated discussions at r/unpopularopinion, r/RealUnpopularOpinion or r/TrueUnpopularOpinion, but if you just want to talk about stuff, r/TheTopicOfTheDay is a lovely environment to share your opinions and experiences.

#Cognitive Biases and Logical Fallacies
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Cognitive Biases and Logical Fallacies are common accusations and practices on Reddit. Fake or deceptive arguments, "junk cognition," (arguments that seem irrefutable but prove nothing), the highlighting of errors in reasoning to undermine the logic of your argument, or irrelevant points made deliberately to derail your comment, Reddit has them all! Thankfully, help is on hand. These are incredibly easy to follow illustrated guides to help you shape your responses.

* [Identifying a Cognitive Bias](https://yourbias.is/)
* [Identifying a Logical Fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/)
* [A searchable database of both](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/)
* [Beginner’s guide to Academic Discourse](https://thebestschools.org/magazine/15-logical-fallacies-know/)
* [A Chart of every Cognitive Bias](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infographics/comments/pcltcl/every_single_cognitive_bias/)

These terms are commonly used in arguments throughout Reddit to try to prove someone else wrong, as if they were ammo to throw around “madlibs” style whenever someone says something that someone else disagrees with or suspects of having a bias. It has been said that “considering an argument invalid or arguing that an argument is invalid because it contains a fallacy, is a fallacy in and of itself” and that is a [whole rabbit hole in itself](https://iep.utm.edu/fallacy/).

Of course, you could also just say [“no u”](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=no%20u) or even [“eat pant”](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bootleg-bart) and scroll away. But where’s the fun in that?

#Coins; Reddit Coins
::Features of Reddit::

[Reddit’s virtual currency](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043034252-What-are-Reddit-Coins-and-how-do-I-use-them-) with which you buy Awards to give to posts or comments you particularly like. You have the option of paying [real money for Coins](https://www.reddit.com/coins), or you can earn one of the larger Awards to get free Coins. Premium subscribers get 700 coins monthly to spend.

If you do wish to spend some of your hard-earned cash to purchase Reddit Coins, it might be good to wait until Reddit has an ‘sale’ on (usually near a holiday) where they give special offers on certain amounts purchased. Before giving any money to Reddit, please familiarise yourself with the [Reddit Premium and Virtual Goods agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/reddit-premium-and-virtual-goods-agreement-october-15-2020).

There is no time limit on using Reddit coins; they will stay in your account until you use them. They are exclusively used for giving awards to other Redditors and cannot be exchanged for any other Reddit feature.

Just like real money, sometimes it seems that your coins just disappear out of nowhere. If you think you have less coins that you should have, you can check on your profile at [https://new.reddit.com/user/me/gilded/given/](https://new.reddit.com/user/me/gilded/given/). Mobile users should open that link with your phone's browser.

If you are experiencing issues with a Reddit Premium subscription or Coin purchase, tell Reddit through the contact form [https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and choose "Premium/Coins/Awards/Powerups Support" from the dropdown menu.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

We have many subs about real-life coins, from r/coins for the new or casual collector to r/CoinClub for the experienced and serious collector. Others include r/coincollecting, r/AncientCoins, r/UKcoins, r/numismatics and many, many more including r/CRH, (Coin-Roll Hunting) which is a subreddit dedicated to searching through rolls of coins from the bank and pocket change.

#Collapse Comments
::General Guides::

Sometimes a huge post that has many replies can be hard to read. If you're on mobile, you can minimise sections of a thread. Just Tap and Hold beside the username of the Parent Comment and this will collapse it and all of its Child Comments. If you're on desktop, you can [press the little line to the left of the comment to do the same](https://gfycat.com/rawanotheradouri).

You might find that Reddit occasionally collapses some comments for you. Mods have the option to auto-collapse comments that have either been deleted or removed, or can use a tool called [Crowd Control](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/e8vl4d/announcing_the_crowd_control_beta/) on accounts that are new to their community.

Occasionally when you are scrolling through comments on a post, you might notice a little link saying [“2 more replies”](https://i.redd.it/p2kcmsdwbwr81.jpg) (or a larger number) on the left hand side (desktop) or centre (mobile) underneath a comment. This is because the rest of the comments in that thread have been auto-collapsed by Reddit, but clicking that link will make them appear.

You will almost certainly see this by scrolling through this Letter-Post-and-Entry-Comment version of my encyclopaedia as because of its size many of the Entry Comments have been auto-collapsed by Reddit, but again, clicking that link will make them appear. Incidentally, in this encyclopaedia, the Entry Comments also might not appear in alphabetical order within each Letter Post, depending on whether or not they have received votes or if I’ve added them at a later date.

#Collectible Avatars
::Features of Reddit::

In July 2022, Reddit [announced](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/blockchain-backed-collectible-avatars-coming-to-reddit-via-new-storefront) the launch of Collectible Avatars - limited-edition avatars made by independent artists, [in partnership with Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/vtkmni/introducing_collectible_avatars/). This was not Reddit’s first foray into the [world of NFTs](https://influencermarketinghub.com/reddit-nft/).

Collectible Avatars have to be purchased with “real money” - not Reddit currency or any type of cryptocurrency. As they are a form of NFT, you will receive instructions on how to set up your wallet to store them. The [Shop](https://i.redd.it/aiz3mivi5rd91.png) option under Profile --> Style Avatar will display the options currently available, along with the costs. There is more information about [the Shop here](https://reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/6213835889044) and at the links on the left-hand side and at the bottom of that page.

Also in August 2022, many Redditors were offered one of [a small selection for free](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollectibleAvatars/comments/wqsuwj/four_collectible_avatar_styles_to_choose_from_who/) with a predictably [mixed response](https://www.reddit.com/r/the_singularity_squad/comments/wuw1yf/is_anyone_getting_hate_from_other_parts_of_reddit/). An interview with the Reddit CEO shortly after shed some light [on the way forward for Reddit](https://www.platformer.news/p/why-reddit-is-still-betting-on-the?triedSigningIn=true) with NFTs, despite negative coverage [elsewhere](https://www.inputmag.com/culture/reddit-digital-collectible-avatar-experiment-nft-fatigue).

You can see the "original" few avatar NFTs on [https://nft.reddit.com/](https://nft.reddit.com/), along with their subsequent sale price (you’ll need to run an ether to dollar conversion). Obviously, NFT rarity and the market [drives the value](https://mashable.com/article/-reddit-sells-nft-cryptosnoos) of purchases over time and remember that absolutely nothing is guaranteed.

* **Obligatory Warning Notices:**

I would advise that before giving any money to Reddit, please familiarise yourself with [this page](https://reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7556522726292-What-is-the-blockchain-and-how-does-it-work-) and its related links, along with the [Previews Terms of Use](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/previews-terms) with special attention to section 1.3 Verified Virtual Goods (a) Collectible Avatars. You might also like to see the interpretation of that [by one Redditor here](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/vtkmni/comment/if97i0p/).

Please also note that [some subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowBan/comments/w4z21h/new_rule_no_one_with_an_official_reddit_nft/) are taking a stand [against NFT avatars](https://www.reddit.com/r/196/comments/vxrawt/anyone_with_one_of_those_dumbass_nft_reddit/) and while that might seem arbitrary, don’t forget that mods reserve the right to restrict users that contravene their general subreddit principles. As always, do please read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) *before* contributing to any sub that is new to you.

Another warning: within days of the launch, I know of one Redditor who bought a collectible avatar but was mocked unmercifully and downvoted to oblivion in a meme/shitposting sub before being banned from it, with the only reason given for the ban being the two words: “NFT Avatar”. As their report to admin came back saying it didn’t violate any policy, make of that what you will.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

The official subreddit r/CollectibleAvatars was created for Redditors to learn more about how to purchase and set up wallets to store the NFTs, and promised to get to know the artists with behind-the-scenes posts, AMAs, and more.  r/avatartrading is the place to discuss all things about selling the Collectible Avatars. Recipients of the free NFTs from August 2022 can show them off at r/awwfriends or r/MemeTeamNFT. At the time of writing, I can’t find a subreddit for The Singularity or Drip Squad fans.

#Comment Chain
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A Comment Chain is when Redditors spontaneously derail a post with a long chain of repeated Child Comments consisting of just one or two words usually prompted by a trigger word or phrase. They can go dozens of comments deep. Be careful when trying to join the comments in this type of chain; make sure that your comment is identical or follows the pattern if it’s a pop-culture reference, or it will be downvoted to oblivion.

It’s a Reddit tradition to pick one random identical comment in a chain to be downvoted to oblivion and another to get upvotes and awards as if it were the best comment in Reddit’s long history. Known as “The Cursed 5th”, this is where the [5th comment in a chain is downvoted](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/srik9g/4th_and_5th_comments_are_cursed/) and you can see it’s insidious effects [in this innocent post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/sxg5cs/oc_my_first_attempt_at_snow_carving/hxs2ufs/).

Other Comment Chain types include “To be fair...” “May I see it?” and basically anything that’s both catchy and pop-culture related. “No, you’re thinking of...”, requires a bit more thought, as does “Increasingly Verbose”.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Places to document these found in the wild include r/commentchains or r/RedditCommentChains.

#Comment Karma
::Essentials for Newbies::

When you submit a Comment, all votes on that comment except the automatic one given by Reddit will be converted to Karma. This is Comment Karma, and it comes from both Parent and Child comments. There isn’t a 1:1 relationship between votes and karma, even though it might look like it does at the early stage of your comment.

**See Also:**

* [Karma](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/4/#wiki_karma)

#Comments
::Essentials for Newbies::

You can make your own Top Level (or ‘Parent’) comments to reply to a post, or reply to other people’s comments in a ‘thread’ (these are ‘Child Comments’). You can see what these both look like from the [illustration here](https://imgur.com/a/DE7DiaL). You cannot normally post images or reaction gifs in a comment but this is a feature slowly being rolled out in some communities with Powerups. However, you can post links.

There’s a 10,000 character limit on each comment. Many of the entries in this encyclopaedia have hit this limit, and if you want to see how that looks, [Christmas on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_christmas_on_reddit) is almost there at 9218. Invisible characters [hidden but used in Markdown text](https://i.redd.it/x50tumrcawu81.jpg), spaces and paragraph breaks also count towards that limit. If you have a long comment to make, [https://www.lettercount.com/](https://www.lettercount.com/) is a useful tool to use, as is [https://redditpreview.com](https://redditpreview.com/).

#Communities
::Essentials for Newbies::

Reddit is organised by subject into user-created boards called Subreddits, or Communities, which cover a variety of topics such as news, politics, science, movies, video games, music, books, sports, hobbies, fitness, cooking, pets, image-sharing and many, many more. Communities is also the title of the list of subreddits that you have joined.

You used to be able to see this list on mobile by clicking the [‘Square-Circle-Square-Magnifying Glass’](https://i.redd.it/nibfggzbcd281.jpg) icon at the bottom, second from the left, but users of the new interface will have to click the three-line “hamburger” or “drawer” menu on the top LH of the screen which will [slide out the list of your communities](https://i.redd.it/7titwy3thwu81.jpg). They will be in alphabetical order with your “favorites” first.

On desktop, you can click on Home (house or spaceship icon) at the top of the page or if you don’t have these, click [your username on the top RH of the page](https://i.redd.it/hnqyrku7jwu81.jpg) or the subreddit [name on the top RH of the page](https://i.redd.it/mj046rqoxwu81.jpg) and the drop down menu lists your communities; again in alphabetical order with your favourites first.

You can organise your communities into two groups by categorising some into “favorites”. On the alphabetical “communities” lists you will see the outline of a star next to each sub. Clicking that star will change its colour and move the subreddit to the top of the page.

#Community Points
::Features of Reddit::

Reddit is experimenting with a feature in limited communities called [Community Points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/). Community Points will be a way for [users to be rewarded](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/what-are-reddit-community-points-13e2a839849b) for their contributions [with a unit of ownership in their Subreddit](https://cointelegraph.com/news/reddit-launches-waitlist-for-site-wide-expansion-of-community-points).

Community Points can be earned, tipped, won, collected, and spent on unique items within a community. Each subreddit will have its own stylisation of Community Points, and the Reddit TOS [can be found here](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/community-points-terms-of-service). There is no official launch date for this to become Reddit-wide as of the time of writing.

#Confirmation Bias
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Confirmation bias is the tendency of people to [favour information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) (unconsciously or otherwise) that confirms their existing beliefs or hypotheses. Confirmation bias happens when we notice evidence that supports our beliefs and ignore evidence that challenges our beliefs. The process is subconscious but it leads to people developing more extreme views. r/confirmationbias.

#Content and Copyright
::General Guides::

Reddit has a [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) which should be understood by all its users. You should also understand the [User Agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-october-15-2020) that you agreed to upon joining Reddit.

* **Reddit content appears outside of Reddit.**

You should be aware that internet outlets desperate for a continual source of new output often [rely on Reddit](https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/zookeepers-reveal-the-dark-lowdown-dirty-inside-secrets-of-zoos/) for their content. There are many [YouTube channels of varying quality](https://www.findachannel.net/Niches/reddit-stories/) devoted to just reading and reacting to Reddit posts. Some YouTubers have their own Subreddits for collecting user-submitted content; others will just collect and broadcast Reddit content without notice, acknowledgement or even asking for permission. Subreddits such as r/entitledparents, r/choosingbeggars and r/prorevenge are targeted especially because of their nature and because Redditors there tend to make an effort in telling their experiences in the manner of a linear story.

* **Your Story, No Credit.**

Clickbait sites, ‘tabloid style’ news sites and even [legitimate news outlets](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/12/huffington-post-banned-reddit-aol) have also jumped on the bandwagon with stories from family drama or wedding-shaming subs like r/weddingshaming, r/bridezillas and r/JUSTNOMIL among others [being especially popular](https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bride-asks-reddit-tacky-ask-guest-make-wedding-decor-gift). They will often leave out just enough identifying information so as to fall into “fair use” while still [retaining the details](https://www.brides.com/story/the-worst-weddings-reddit). The extent of this can be seen from this [screenshot of the Culture section](https://i.redd.it/rhwwvtqdpwu81.jpg)of my subscription to Apple News. And I don’t even have Reddit as a filter or preferred source on my subscription.

* **Who owns the copyright on Reddit comments and self-posts?**

That’s a good question [often asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3uz0s1/who_owns_the_copyright_on_reddit_comments_and/) and the general conclusion is this: nobody knows. There is a school of thought that the freshly updated Reddit [New User Agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement) now gives Reddit the right to sell your original pictures and other content in all media formats and channels as of September 2021, [and you waive any and all claims with regard to your content](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/p3chza/just_a_quick_note_that_the_freshly_updated_reddit/).

Either way, your Reddit story could well be monetised in some way by any random third party and you will rarely be asked for permission, acknowledged as the author or share in any profit. Reddit actually has [Press Guidelines](https://www.redditinc.com/assets/press-resources/broadcast_2020.pdf) which you might find interesting, along with a general [press/media/brand guide](https://www.redditinc.com/press).

Copypasta is internet slang for any block of text that gets copied and pasted over and over again.  [“I only need two buttons, Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V”.](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/fclp63/i_only_need_two_buttons_ctrlc_ctrlv/). Named for the keyboard action Copy and Paste, Copypasta is huge chunks of text saved to copy & paste elsewhere as a satirical wall of words vaguely related to the topic in question. Why? Who knows, but copypastas are said to be similar to spam as they are often used to annoy other users and disrupt online discourse.

Original work can sometimes be [very well received](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/m5w225/steaming_wood_in_order_to_bend_a_ridiculous/gr2ls1t/). The shortest, most common Copypasta is “I just downvoted your comment.” The full version [is here but seldom used](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/dk3sff/i_just_downvoted_your_comment/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

There is an archive at r/copypasta and another one at r/CopyPastas. Why? Why not.

#Creating A Subreddit
::General Guides::

It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting. Yes, Dear Redditor, the time has come, for whatever reason, for you to become the ~~ruler~~ owner of your own ~~domain~~ subreddit. There are several ways of doing this:

* **Creating A Subreddit 1: Make Your Own Sub**

At one time you needed a 30 day old account and around 25-50 karma to create a subreddit, but this was relaxed in early 2021 and now anyone can make their own subreddit straight away. Here are some useful links and guides to start with.

* [https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043044012-How-do-I-create-a-community-](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043044012-How-do-I-create-a-community-)
* [https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001656752-Things-to-know-before-creating-a-subreddit](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001656752-Things-to-know-before-creating-a-subreddit)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/mmwdrh/new\_community\_creator\_onboarding\_tool/](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/mmwdrh/new_community_creator_onboarding_tool/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/2yob6r/creating\_a\_subreddit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/2yob6r/creating_a_subreddit/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/modguide/comments/hnnv23/setting\_up\_your\_first\_sub\_on\_mobile/](https://www.reddit.com/r/modguide/comments/hnnv23/setting_up_your_first_sub_on_mobile/)

If you need a little individual guidance, there are plenty of experienced subreddit starters on r/NewToReddit and r/LearnToReddit who will help you.

* **Creating a Subreddit 2: Adopt an Existing Sub**

You might occasionally come across a Subreddit that hasn’t been active in a long time, and it might be eligible for adoption. I even mention a few throughout this encyclopaedia. Dead or abandoned subreddits exist for a number of reasons, mostly due to the inactivity of its moderators. Subreddits are considered "abandoned" in the event that none of its mods have been active anywhere on Reddit in the past 60 days. In 2021, Reddit started to [archive dormant subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/o18ct9/creating_new_opportunities_for_future_community/). To the consternation of some owners who returned after a prolonged absence, the subreddits were renamed with alphabetical and numerical titles to allow their mods to archive the posts.

At the time of writing this, Reddit has no plans to [completely remove these subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/o5ymis/an_update_on_creating_new_opportunities_for/) from the site, but that could change in the future.

You might even want to repurpose a previously banned sub, such as Redditor u/PM_ME_YOUR_TITS_GIRL who requests old porn subs like r/PrettyPussy and converts them to a subreddit for cat pics/gifs.

So, first, find your Subreddit. Here are some useful places to start:

* r/adoptareddit \- allows moderators to hand off a sub. Admins will grant mod privileges in certain circumstances.
* r/availablesubs \- lists of abandoned or moderatorless subreddits.
* r/deadsubs \- “the graveyard of Reddit”, probably dead itself ironically.
* r/findareddit \- can help you find any sub, not just dead ones.
* r/Inactivereddits \- a community finding inactive/unmoderated subreddits.
* r/reclassified \- who track and discuss banned and quarantined subreddits.
* r/Requestable \- A catalogue of defunct subreddits, itself defunct.
* r/subreddit \- to share an unrecognized subreddit or to find a subreddit you've been looking for.
* r/SubsToRequest \- for those interested in sharing and requesting abandoned, inactive & banned subreddits.

Your next step is to go to r/redditrequest and [ask to take over the subreddit that you'd like to mod](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043478471-How-to-request-subreddit-via-Reddit-Request-). Reddit Request requires accounts to be 90 days old with 500 combined karma to take on a sub, and you ABSOLUTELY MUST read the rules at r/redditrequest thoroughly before posting a request. These will be found in the Sidebar (on mobile this will be the About tab, Menu tab and Community Info found in the three dot “hamburger” menu top RH corner of your screen), any Pinned posts (these will have a lime green ‘pin’ icon on the top corner and will show on top when you sort the Subreddit by ‘Hot’) and Wiki (where there is one).

You might, in time, get a message “This subreddit was banned due to a violation of Reddit’s content policy against creating or repurposing a sub to reconstitute or serve the same objective as a banned or quarantined subreddit.” Be aware that the "ban evasion" bot can be [somewhat over enthusiastic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/hx46uy/lets_fix_the_subreddit_ban_evasion_problem/). Reddit loves being meta.

* **Creating a Subreddit 3: Moderation**

If you are inviting *The Average Redditor*™ to participate on your Subreddit, you will eventually need to remove objectionable or off topic posts and comments, officially warn someone for spamming or even ban a particularly abusive user from posting or commenting. See, mods *can*be useful after all. Here’s a list of resources:

* [https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204533859-What-is-a-moderator-](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204533859-What-is-a-moderator-)
* r/needamod To become a mod without the responsibility of creating and owning your own subreddit.
* r/AvailableSubs To become a mod without the responsibility of creating your own subreddit.
* r/modguide Invaluable help and assistance from some familiar names!
* r/modsupport
* r/modhelp
* r/modclub
* r/modnews
* r/SubSettingsPractice
* [https://www.reddit.com/wiki/automoderator](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/automoderator)
* [https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us)
* [https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002334871-Communities-for-moderators](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002334871-Communities-for-moderators)
* [https://www.reddit.com/wiki/moddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/moddiquette)

We are also working on some initiatives at r/NewToReddit and r/LearnToReddit to help users set up and maintain their own communities.

[Mod Certification](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4489913994509-Moderator-Certification) is an initiative introduced by Reddit in 2021 to help train and certify new moderators.  r/ModCertification101 and the follow-up r/ModCertification201 are a great resource in moderator training, and Reddit recommends all new mods take the courses to gain a better understanding of moderation tooling and best practices all round. They’re very comprehensive and you’ll get a couple of [nice trophies](https://preview.redd.it/r1h9f3h2dsp71.png?width=93&format=png&auto=webp&s=be67d084699e6e267674a8d69e2e8f6e1913e3ba) for your [profile too](https://i.imgur.com/VfWEP9f.png)!

* **Creating a Subreddit 4: Promotion**

If your shiny new sub has little to no karma restrictions for new users, we would be delighted to promote it at r/NewToReddit as part of our rules and welcome guidance. Contact us via Modmail to discuss the details. If your sub relates to something you are marketing, you need to be aware of [Reddit’s guidelines for self promotion](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

* r/PromoteReddit \- Subreddits must be open (not private and not restricted). Please post secret subs to r/SecretReddits instead
* r/promote \- General promotion
* r/freepromote \- General promotion, but mostly subreddits
* r/shamelessplug \- Showcase your website, project, game or anything else you've been working hard on
* r/newreddits \- Promote your brand new subreddit
* r/notsonewreddits \- Promote your not so new subreddit
* r/newreddits_NSFW \- Promote your NSFW subreddit
* r/yoursub \- General subreddit promotion
* r/Subredditads \- Submit your subreddit to be considered for free advertising and promotion on Reddit
* r/Facebookpages \- Promote your facebook pages/groups
* r/AdvertiseYourServer \- Primarily for promoting your discord server

#creepyasterisks
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A link or phrase posted when a post or comment contains words written \* between asterisks \* to denote performing an action. Often benign \* tips hat \* these can also become [somewhat creepy](https://i.redd.it/p7fapud5s9i01.jpg). Sometimes known on the interwebs as [“Asteracting” or "Bounding Asterisks”](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=asteract). Using asterisks this way on Reddit actually *changes the text to italic* unless further markdown is used. r/creepyasterisks.

#Crosspost
::General Guides::

Crossposting is where someone else’s content has been carried across to another Subreddit by another user. So, for instance, if you see a post about a cute spider in r/awwnverts and you think that r/spiderbro would love it too (or r/mildlyterrifying, depending on your viewpoint) you might decide to Crosspost it there. If you do, it is good practice to include a disclaimer, alerting the audience that the post is a Crosspost (or x-post) of the original, [like this example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Visiblemending/comments/suvh5g/what_a_sweet_thing_to_do_xpost_from_rmarvelmemes/). You’ll need to make sure that you understand the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) before you do this as Crossposting in a subreddit that doesn’t allow it will cause your post to be deleted and may result in a ban.

Reddit has a native feature for crossposting existing content to another subreddit. Click on the Share button below any post you wish to crosspost, then from the drop-down menu, click on Crosspost. On mobile, this is also an option on the Hamburger menu. On the next page, select the community you want to crosspost to, then enter a title or quote, and add a label or a flair, if necessary.

#Cunningham’s Law
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

An Eponymous Law named for [Howard (Ward) Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham#Cunningham%27s_Law) which states: "The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer.", referring to the observation that people are quicker to correct a wrong answer than in spending time to answer the actual question.

As you would imagine, being wrong about something brings out the pre-diddley-ictable Reddit Hivemind like little else. Here, the plight of an unhappy animal [in an environment it would find very uncomfortable](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/mpo1c0/the_lamas_is_almost_one_of_the_most_beautiful/) was all but overlooked in favour of pointing out it wasn’t a “lamas” as OP claimed - or even a llama, as OP presumably meant. Two for the price of one is twice as much fun - except for the alpaca in question.

An excellent meta moment occurred in this next example when someone incorrectly cited Cunningham’s Law [only to be roundly corrected](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/7m8gbp/sick_nerd_200iq/drs6qzp/?context=3) for confusing their adages. Ah, Reddit; never change.

This next link isn’t quite Cunningham’s Law but glories in an OP being totally and utterly destroyed after their movie review of [Terminator: Genysis](https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/33ggow/teminator_genysis_review_spoilers/cql4e04/) was proved wrong - without any possibility of a comeback whatsoever!

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Someone started r/CunninghamsLaw. It would be great if someone revived it. In the meantime, r/OpIsFuckingStupid collects posts about the OP of a post being, well, fucking stupid.

#cursedcomments
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A link or phrase posted when a comment is an unexpected source of dark humour, evoking simultaneous feelings of fear, concern and guilty humour, often leaving the reader quite speechless.  r/cursedcomments is Reddit’s home to comments that strike you in the same way as having your brains smashed out with a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.

For a comment (or [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursed_image)) to be considered "cursed," it must originate from a relatively surprising source, preferably benign, and be perceived as unexpected, unwanted or upsetting. Cursed comments require a dark sense of humour to enjoy but the best part is that the incomprehension of the comment you just read (or the blatant [gruesomeness](https://i.redd.it/jzf7gam6s1v81.jpg) of it) is also enough to draw a smile on your face before striking you into sweet oblivion. A very good explanation of what makes something cursed in this way [can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cursed_Images/comments/l2an3d/read_before_posting_definition_of_a_cursed_image/).

These subs are a rich source of content for many YouTubers to read or react to, and many of these will have their own subreddits either dedicated to or sometimes frequented by them. Reddit loves being meta.

Cursed Comment humour subs include:

* r/cursedcomments \- titles must begin with Cursed\_ eg. Cursed\_Potato
* r/cursedcursedcomments \- for extremely cursed comments
* r/cursedmemes \- generally vaguely dark, post-ironic memes without specific templates
* r/cursedimages \- no memes here, just cursed images
* r/cursedimagesanarchy \- less restrictive cursed images
* r/Cursed_Images \- very restrictive but genuinely cursed images
* r/cursedcats \- cats that haunt your dreams
* r/CursedCatImages \- currently dormant; might be ripe for adoption?
* r/cursedfoods \- food that haunts your dreams

As always, you must read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) of these subreddits carefully before you contribute. There is also a crucial difference between Cursed and Blursed that you need to know. Blursed = blessed + cursed. If a picture brings you joy and comfort BUT also creeps you out or confuses you, it's considered "blursed".

Funny “cursed comment subs” mustn’t be confused with those classed as “cursed subs” which is a collection of the most vile subs to ever plague Reddit and are extremely NSFW and/or NSFL. Again, just like “NSFW”, the prefix “cursed” is becoming a nomenclature that really does require some extra clarification.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/distressingmemes is for memes you might find distressing, disturbing, haunting, unsettling, or otherwise off-putting, without being overtly shocking or direct, and r/void_memes is for memes so abstract, surreal, and fried that one would say they've entered the void, while r/oddlyterrifying deals with the oddly terrifying. As the word “cursed” has different associations, I would be remiss in not mentioning r/NetflixSeriesCursed; a community dedicated to the Netflix Original Series: Cursed.

#Cursed Subs
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Redditors are not obliged to fall in love with, like, or even approve of every user base here. We’re a microcosm of internet life, not an internet utopia no matter how much we might want it to be. Some people are not here at Reddit for the cute puppies; they’re here for content forsaken by all that is Holy: the Cursed Subs. That shabby corner of God's allotment where He lets the nettles grow. Subs that cause an unpleasant emotional reaction to its content; subs that to the rational person provoke a combination of disgust and bewilderment. Visit them at your own risk. They will most likely be extremely gruesome, NSFW and/or [NSFL](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_nsfl).

**Neither this subreddit nor myself endorses or supports the "cursed" subreddits mentioned here.** Nevertheless, they exist and you should be prepared to come across one accidentally or unwittingly. As always, READ THE RULES of any subreddit before posting or commenting.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/whydoesthisexist is reasonably mild for this genre.  r/SubsIWishDidntExist and r/cursedsubreddits have links for more extreme subs. r/theworstsubs demonstrates that there are always more, and worse, as does r/cursedsubs.

#Custom Feed
::General Guides::

You can organise lists of your followed subreddits into [Custom Feeds](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043043412-What-is-a-custom-feed-and-how-do-I-make-one-). You can keep your custom feeds private for your own use, or make them public to share. Formerly known as “Multireddits”, and you might still see some people use that name. This is more than just a list of your followed subreddits [and you’ll find more details here of what they are and do](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/bpfyx1/introducing_custom_feeds_plus_a_community_contest/).

We have a custom feed of our \[no-to-low karma friendly subreddits, [which you can join here](https://www.reddit.com/user/solariahues/m/newuser_friendly_subs/).

* **Creating a Custom Feed**

I use the official Reddit app on mobile iOS but I’m given to believe the desktop version is much the same. Here’s an illustrated guide to [creating a custom feed](https://thenextweb.com/basics/2019/07/19/reddit-custom-feeds-multis/).

On mobile, Open the [three bar menu on the top left](https://i.redd.it/7titwy3thwu81.jpg) and the “Your Communities” menu will drop down. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the community list and it should say [Custom Feeds](https://i.redd.it/amigke0pv3v81.jpg). Click this to give you the list of your existing feeds and the [option to create a new one](https://i.redd.it/kda5jd92l9v81.jpg)and just follow the prompts.

* **Adding a sub to your Custom Feed at any time**

Go to the front page of the subreddit you want to add. Look for the [three dots “hamburger” menu](https://i.redd.it/kxv72kyug9v81.jpg) on the top right hand side, and one of the options should be "Add To Custom Feed". This will give you a list of your existing Custom Feeds or prompt you to make a new one. On desktop or browser, you can do this by pressing the “hamburger” menu [on the About Community](https://i.redd.it/1csvwswej9v81.jpg) tab.

* **Finding your Custom Feeds**

Open the [three bar menu](https://i.redd.it/7titwy3thwu81.jpg) on the top left and the “Your Communities” menu will drop down. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the community list and it should say [Custom Feeds](https://i.redd.it/y7b2gudoy3v81.jpg). It’s the same [on mobile](https://i.redd.it/amigke0pv3v81.jpg).

You can bump your Custom Feeds to nearer the top of the list by pressing the star next to it. This turns it into a “Favorite” and “Custom Feeds” will now appear at or near the top of the “Your Communities” menu. Optionally - but a more long-winded way that I haven’t tried - you could apparently “Unfavorite” and “Refavorite” any other community on the list so it brings Custom Feeds to the very top. As I say, I haven’t tried this so I can’t say for sure that this’ll work.

* **Deleting a Custom Feed**

If the custom feed was created by someone else, click on it as if you were going to browse it, then you [can unfollow it](https://i.redd.it/1skgyi9zr9v81.jpg) from its “Hamburger” menu.

To delete a custom feed you made, click on it as if you were going to browse it, then you [can delete it](https://i.redd.it/7axe9j7e4bv81.jpg). You will still be Joined (if you were) to the subreddits that were part of that feed.

* **Removing a sub from your Custom Feed**

To delete a sub from your custom feed, on mobile there are two options on the top of the page: “Posts” and “Communities”. Clicking Communities gives a list of the subs within that feed and on the right will say “Edit” which [will bring up a list of dustbin icons on the right](https://i.redd.it/6iv4rweq5bv81.jpg). Click those to remove one or more subs from your feed.

I don’t think there’s a way of deleting a sub from a custom feed that you follow.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

You can share or join custom feeds at r/multihub. A sleepy sub that needs revising is r/customfeeds.

**See Also:**

* [Home Feed](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/4/#wiki_home_feed)

D

#DAE
::Acronyms and Initials::

“Does Anyone Else”. Originally sub specific from r/DAE and r/DoesAnybodyElse now with wider Reddit usage.

DAE know if you should post your burning question in r/DAE (or r/DoesAnybodyElse) or r/AskReddit? The general rule from AskReddit is this: if your question can generally be answered with "I Agree" or "Me too", then it's a DAE question. If you're looking for affirmation of something you think, or to see if other people do the same thing you do, then it's a DAE question. "Am I the only one who ..." or "Is it just me, or ..." or "Who else..." type questions are all DAE and will also be removed from AskReddit.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

There are many subreddits for asking specific questions, and a good place to start [is this list and custom feed](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditlists/comments/1f08tj/list_and_multireddit_of_subreddits_for_asking/), while r/amiwrong is a place to let Redditors decide whether or not you were right or wrong in a given scenario. However, r/Showerthoughts is for sharing those miniature epiphanies you have that highlight the oddities within the familiar.

#Dealing with Trolls
::General Guides::

How often it is that the angry Redditor rages denial of what his inner self is telling him. Why some people are so angry - about a multitude of topics - puzzles me. That they have no qualms or conscience about venting their disdain for other people online is mystifying. Sadly, it seems it’s just the reality of the world we live in today, and no matter how hard you try, sometimes snark just happens. It isn’t pleasant. It always feels targeted.  [And sometimes, it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ea8aw/i_am_a_irl_internet_troll_ama/).

If a similar situation happens to you and you start feeling like people are attacking you, **stop responding.** Don’t double down or try to further explain your point. Your emotions may be telling you to confront, and the anonymity of social media gives us the illusion that we can get away with aggression.  But you won’t get very far against  *The Undisputed Expert Professional Troll*™ who’s well seasoned and practised at internet trolling and you might only make things worse. You might not want to go back to that sub but you don’t want to be permabanned from it either. But all is not lost. Your best response is no response and I’ll tell you exactly why.

* Trolls Hate This One Simple Trick

Remember, other people only understand stuff from their level of perception, and moving out of that level is rarely achieved by discourse with someone they perceive to be on a lower level of awareness than them. That, I’m afraid, is everyone else except them. And, the more they prove their superiority to themselves, the bigger their dopamine hit. There’s nothing to be gained by arguing with someone of that mindset; if you ever encounter one just downvote them, move on and leave them to simmer in their own self-righteousness.

* Why?

Because you can put money down on that person now refreshing the page constantly, even frantically, to no avail waiting for your reply and the chance to win the closure they’ll never get. Instead, let them spend their time gleefully fomenting the perfect snarky reply to your next comment and instead, **you** get that all-important dopamine hit from inwardly revelling at the fact they’ll be devastated when they can’t use it because you moved on in a mature fashion and they didn’t. You’re not only denying them their triumph; you’re taking their prize. Don't let the bastards grind you down.

#Deleted or Removed
::Essentials for Newbies::

Comments can be deleted by the originator, mod, admin or automod bot. When the username says \[deleted\] and the body of the post says \[removed\], this usually implies a moderator, admin, or spam filter action removed the comment. If the user deleted their post, both username and body will say \[deleted\]. If the user deleted their account, all their posts and comments throughout Reddit will now say \[deleted\]. Admin removed comments may also say something to the effect of ‘Removed by Reddit for X’ where X is a reason.

Deleting or removing a comment will only remove that particular comment. If the comment still exists as part of a discussion, only the comment and username will be removed. Redditors cannot delete other users comments so the rest of the comment thread will remain intact. When a post has been removed by the mods it will remain in your post/comment history.

In some extreme cases it means the user has deleted their account; perhaps after a negative comment spurs controversy or if they felt something could "out them" if they gave away too many personal details etc. To preempt having to do this, people sometimes create single-use Throwaway Accounts for posting on subjects that they may not want associated with their regular account for whatever reason and delete them afterwards.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Sometimes a whole comment chain will say \[removed\] and speculation about what happened goes on at r/removed.

#Demographics
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Reddit is the internet’s hub for opinions, and the site boasts millions of users daily, with plenty of diversity across all areas of age, experience, knowledge, nationality, gender, ethnicity and any other demographic you could possibly name. However, the majority of Redditors do share a few key traits: namely, their age. There are many places online that analyse Reddit data for many things (usually marketing or advertising) and a general interest one can be found at [https://thrivemyway.com/reddit-statistics/](https://thrivemyway.com/reddit-statistics/).

A user at r/dataisbeautiful made a [visualisation](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5700sj/octhe_results_of_the_reddit_demographics_survey/) of the Reddit Demographics Survey 2016 from the data collected from users on r/Samplesize.

More recently, most of the metrics agree that although Reddit has users of all ages, the largest group of Redditors are between 18 and 29, making up a whopping 64% of Reddit users. The next largest group, users between 30 and 49 years old, makes up 29% of Redditors. 

Because of this, a genre of subreddits has grown where members of one demographic can ask questions of those from another, which include:

* r/AskOldPeople \- to ask general questions to people who are Generation X (1965-1980) or older
* r/AskOldPeopleAdvice \- to ask for advice from people who are hopefully older and wiser
* r/AskWomenOver30 \- civil discussions with older women Redditors
* r/AskMenOver30 \- a place for supportive and friendly conversations among the over 30s
* r/AskWomen \- for questions about women's thoughts, lives, and experiences
* r/AskMen \- who claim they don't know, but they’ll answer anyway
* r/AskParents \- for questions you want to ask other parents or daren’t ask your own parents
* r/AskTeens \- to ask other teens questions

Other age-related subs include:

* r/FuckImOld \- for those little things in life that suddenly remind you of your advancing years
* r/RedditForGrownups \- a community for Redditors that are starting to get that "get off my lawn" feeling whenever they check their front page
* r/teenagers \- the biggest community run by teenagers for teenagers

Directories of similar subreddits include [this list of all the teen subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/pbnog/roundup_of_all_the_teen_subreddits/), a list for people who just need [someone to talk to](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/directory) with specific remits, and r/ListOfSubreddits have lots of lists of subreddits, including this [mega indexed Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/wiki/listofsubreddits/) of many different demographics of Redditors.

While the site definitely skews towards young people, there's a fairly decent contingent of the older crew here as well, and we get everywhere. I myself am over 60 and have more than 1,500 subreddits in my subscriptions.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/oldpeoplefacebook because Grandma and Grandpa have finally joined social media, and they love sharing their opinions with everyone.

#Direct Chat
::Essentials for Newbies::

A form of private messaging on Reddit (the speech bubble icon). New Reddit accounts [have certain limits](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060638392-Why-can-t-I-start-a-chat-) on Chat, Direct Messages and Following. These will lessen with account age.

Major changes to chat [came into force in late 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/pu4p6p/now_you_can_share_images_and_use_slash_commands/) including the option to share images.

When someone wants to use Direct Chat with you, you’ll get a request to chat which you can either accept or refuse. It is a good idea to check the posting history of the requester before you accept; that'll give you a better idea of whether they're acting in good faith or not. You should start a chat when you expect to be talking to someone for a longer period of time, or if you think you may wish to continue at an unspecified date in the future. With Direct Chat, you can see the whole thread of your conversations with one person at any one time.

Because the Chat facility is frequently used by Spambots, you can change it by going to User Settings - Chat & Messaging so only accounts older than 30 days can chat with you. It can also be turned off entirely in the same way. You'll see options for "Who can send you" Chat Requests/Private Messages, and 'Nobody' is an option for both.

#Direct Message
::Essentials for Newbies::

A Direct Message (or DM) is another mode of private communication on Reddit. Communications specifically to you from Reddit (e.g. bans, suspensions, mods deleting posts etc.) will be made this way; also some notifications that you have received an award from someone or welcome messages to some subreddits. See your messages at: [https://www.reddit.com/message/inbox](https://www.reddit.com/message/inbox).

Please note that new accounts or those with no-or-low Karma [cannot send DMs](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059271571--I-get-an-error-when-I-try-to-send-a-private-message-What-s-happening-).

Direct Messages are only sortable by date and personal conversations can easily get lost down the page. You can DM someone by clicking on their name. DM options can be turned on and off in your Account Settings (the options on your username tab on mobile).

Please don’t respond to unsolicited DMs asking for money or offering financial services, no matter how sad or genuine the story appears.  [Reddit is often targeted by scammers in this way](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/p35tef/recent_scams_targeting_the_sub_please_read/). If this happens to you, [report the message](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058752951-How-do-I-report-a-private-message-), block the user and move on.

#Discord
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Discord is a voice, video and text communication service. A semi-private hosting service for chatting, many subreddits have their own Discord server. r/discordapp. Reddit and Discord go hand in hand in this little corner of the internet and our own server invite link is: [https://discord.gg/tCTAMyTDp4](https://discord.gg/tCTAMyTDp4)

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/discordapp is an unofficial & community-run sub. As the word “discord” has different associations, I would be remiss in not mentioning r/Discord, subreddit for the eponymous character from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. (I said e*pony*mous, hahahaha)

#“Does subreddit contain profanity?"
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

You may have seen this or [similar questions](https://preview.redd.it/v7p98cfg40361.gif?format=mp4&s=78c8fa0b946b0f7fb22e4e557f7d8df88abbf654) pop up occasionally. Reddit is currently working on a [classification system](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hoac3v/keeping_reddit_real_subreddit_content/) to help in filtering content. Over recent months, Reddit has [removed certain NSFW subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/lhnvok/removing_sexually_explicit_content_from_rall/) from r/all, and are crowdsourcing our help [in tagging subreddit content](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/k60vti/another_update_on_subreddit_classification_efforts/) to broaden this even more.

It has led to some hilarious juxtapositions of inappropriate questions in wholesome subreddits [like this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/illegallysmolbirbs/comments/sl4nuq/yes/).

#“Doggo Speak”
::Jargon and Slang::

Is your “pupper smol but angy?” Want to “boop that snoot”? Got a “heckin’ derp of a danger noodle” you want to show off? Maybe your “borb is an absolute unit” or your “floofy chonker void did a mlem”? Welcome to the wonderful world of Doggo Speak, where a snake is a snek, a person is a hooman, a spider is a spooder and many Redditors are clawing their eyes out in despair.

Also known as DoggoLingo, [this is cutesy speak presented as what humans have long believed goes on in the canine brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoggoLingo) and a language trend that's been [gaining steam on the Internet in the past few years](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/04/23/524514526/dogs-are-doggos-an-internet-language-built-around-love-for-the-puppers).

Originally specific to cute animal subs such as r/blep, r/Blerps, r/blop or r/mlem which are all Subreddits for animals showing their tongues in some way, Doggo Speak now has wider Reddit usage. Use at your peril. Except at r/ProperAnimalNames where you can go wild and invent your own…

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/doggohate absolutely love the animals, but really hate the cutesy talk.  r/Dogfree absolutely [dislike both](https://www.reddit.com/r/JustUnsubbed/comments/b44of7/just_unsubbed_from_rdogfree/).

#DM
::Essentials for Newbies::

Direct Message. This is explained more in the entry “Direct Message”, but a Direct Message is a mode of private communication on Reddit. Communications specifically to you from Reddit (e.g. bans, suspensions, mods deleting posts etc.) will be made this way; also some notifications that you have received an award from someone or welcome messages to some subreddits.

#dontdeadopeninside
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A link posted when a picture shows a sign or other media that reads as nonsense if read from left to right. The name "Don't Dead Open Inside" is based on a promotional poster for *The Walking Dead* TV series which features [one of the most recognized examples of the trope in popular culture](https://i.imgur.com/RvUNMso.jpg). Be careful posting this link; r/dontdeadopeninside is a sub where the rules are tightly enforced. If you want to submit something there, browse to get a feel of the place and be sure to understand their rules.  r/dontdeadopeninside.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

You could try the more lenient but less well known r/dontopendeadinside. We also have r/AutomatiCautionDoor for words in stacks, r/peanutbutterisoneword where the instructions are printed by mistake on the customised thing you ordered, and r/nosafetysmokingfirst where you aren’t sure if something should be read left to right or top to bottom.

#”Doot”
::Jargon and Slang::

A vote, usually short for “Updoot” meaning upvote. Originally from the 2011 “Skull Trumpet” or “Doot Doot” meme, which features a [computer-animated skull](https://youtu.be/WnRrPqgKBS0) playing two notes on a trumpet. The skull became known as Mr. Skeltal and his sound as a doot. “Updoot” is a word often used by Reddit content collectors on Facebook or YouTube channels, and often associated with r/dankmemes.

The [Updoot Award](https://i.imgur.com/54fJKZr.jpg) costs 300 coins and the [animated Doot Doot award](https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Updoot_32.png) costs 400 coins. Neither give any additional benefits, and r/Showerthoughts believe both are [impossible](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/fo4hz4/the_doot_doot_award_is_impossible_skeletons_cant/) in any event.

#Downvote
::Essentials for Newbies::

Downvote was originally meant for use when someone isn’t contributing to the discussion or is off-topic, not just a disagree button. However, it’s now used more as a term equivalent to “dislike” on other social networks. Each downvote slightly reduces the post or comment Karma of the person you are downvoting. You can only downvote once on each post or comment, and it is reversible if you change your mind. You don’t lose Karma yourself for downvoting. Apparently. So I’ve read. (I’ve also read that you do). Your downvote score is visible to others, as is your upvote score, but nobody can tell what individual posts or comments you upvote or downvote.

Some subreddits have chosen to replace the default “arrow” icons with ones of their own. In case it isn’t obvious which is which, the Downvote will be on the bottom (Old Reddit; desktop) or on the right (Mobile App).

Individual subreddits have the option to hide vote visibility for up to a day, as a method of encouraging legitimate voting and discouraging the “bandwagon effect”. Upvotes and downvotes are still being counted and will eventually become visible. These posts may have the word *vote* instead of [displaying the number](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204511579-Why-can-t-I-see-how-many-upvotes-a-post-or-comment-has-sometimes-).

“Contest Mode” is also sometimes used by Mods to keep voting secret. While this mode is enabled, you won’t be able to sort comments (if you do) as it randomises them. No posts will appear to have been upvoted or downvoted even if they have, and the comments won’t even be in the same order each time you read the post. Once the Mods re-enable Normal Mode, you’ll get to see the votes and the comments will act as normal once again.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/ExplainMyDownvotes is a place for Redditors to help find the answers to why the Internet hasn't taken kindly to their contributions.

#DownvotedToOblivion
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A link or phrase posted when people get lots of downvotes in a very short space of time. Users who are ‘officially’ considered to be Downvoted to Oblivion if they achieve a downvote score of less than -100. [The most downvoted comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/?context=3&st=k089mt0z&sh=f2908b00) in Reddit history (so far) was so notorious it even has its own entry in [The Guinness World Records](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/503152-most-downvoted-comment-on-reddit). Posts, however, cannot reach less than 0 downvotes.

While that one is unlikely to be beaten, there are still [some other spectacular scores](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfComments/wiki/downvoted) which occasionally, some users try to emulate. Why do people seek/farm downvotes? Who knows. But to prevent a race to the bottom, the maximum amount of negative karma you can have on your profile is -100.  r/DownvotedToOblivion.

#Doxxing
::General Guides::

Also known as Doxing, this is revealing personal information about someone, including yourself. We do not do that on Reddit.

Do not post someone's personal information or post links to personal information. This includes links to public Social Media pages and screenshots of Social Media pages with the names still legible. We all get outraged by the ignorant things people say and do online, but witch hunts and vigilantism [hurt innocent people too often](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/d7m1c/dear_internet_vigilantes_and_lynch_mobs/), and such posts or comments will be removed. Users posting personal info are subject to an immediate site wide ban. If you see a user posting personal info, [please contact the admins](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23reddit.com&subject=posting+of+personal+info).

Please make sure to remove or block out any personal information, including other Redditors’ usernames, in all your posts or screenshots of Reddit stuff too. Anyone who deliberately pings the subject of a post where the usernames are blocked out will be banned. We can laugh at people without directly harassing or bullying them.

If it's a celebrity or public figure then you might not be required to block out the name unless it’s in the rules of the Subreddit, but it is always advisable to check first.

#Duck Test
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

The Duck Test is a saying commonly known as an “Eponymous Law”, but more accurately as a [Philosophical Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor) that reads [”If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test).

Applied broadly, this particular principle suggests that what you see is what you get. The Duck Test is a form of logical, intuitive reasoning used to deduce the nature of an uncertain thing or situation, usually in the absence or in spite of concrete evidence.

Similarly, the term Elephant Test refers to situations in which an idea or thing "is hard to describe, but instantly recognizable when spotted" - otherwise known as [“I know it when I see it”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it); a colloquial expression by which a speaker attempts to categorize an observable fact or event, although the category is subjective or lacks clearly defined parameters.

* **When a duck is not a duck**

While a philosophical razor can be a useful mental shortcut that allows you to make decisions and solve problems quickly and easily, it is not an unbreakable law or rule.

An obvious limitation to the duck test is abstraction: one may be observing a duck, but also a video of a duck, an animatronic robot-duck, a child dressed as a duck, or some other waterfowl. In these cases, tangible, additional information would negate the conclusion from the Duck Test.

The Duck Test can also lead to contradictory results. For example, marijuana cannot be shown to be a legal or an illegal substance through the Duck Test, since it reflects equally many characteristics from both sides.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Waterfowl are well represented on Reddit, and good places to start are r/duck: The subreddit for people who keep, or love, ducks; r/babyduckgifs: A place to see the amazing adventures of ducklings and r/ducklings: A subreddit for pictures of cute ducklings, duckling facts, and general duckling things.

Ducks that aren’t aquatic can be found at r/ducks: for the University of Oregon Athletics; r/AnaheimDucks: for the Anaheim Ducks Hockey Club and r/uglyduckling: for all you guys and gals out there who turned into butterflies.

#Dunning-Kruger Effect
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

An Eponymous Law. Very simplistically, this is where people's inability to recognize their lack of ability leads them to think they are better at something than they actually are; for example, when someone completing a 101 course on a subject means they believe they are now a world expert on it. Sometimes known as False Authority Syndrome, and known as far back as the 18th century as ['A little knowledge is a dangerous thing'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_little_knowledge_is_a_dangerous_thing). It is related to the cognitive bias of [illusory superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority) and comes from people's inability to recognize their lack of ability.

According to the [psychology researchers David Dunning & Justin Kruger](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12688660_Unskilled_and_Unaware_of_It_How_Difficulties_in_Recognizing_One%27s_Own_Incompetence_Lead_to_Inflated_Self-Assessments), this is where people that are poor in "logical reasoning, grammar, financial knowledge, math, emotional intelligence... rate their actual expertise as high as experts". A very authoritative sounding person only having a small amount of knowledge can mislead people into thinking that they are more expert than they really are, which can lead to mistakes being made.

An accusation of someone using a logical fallacy is often employed on Reddit when the OP’s goal of achieving common agreement is more important to them than utilizing sound reasoning. Usually it's done intentionally to detract from or even derail the argument to persuade people that their point of view is the only correct one. Reddit is extremely pedantic about logical fallacies, of which this is one. Or is it? Discuss at r/DunningKruger.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

On r/BadArt, some contributors are aware they may never be the next big thing. Not on r/delusionalartists though!  r/confidentlyincorrect is a subreddit for people who act smug about the wrong answer, as is r/ConfidentlyWrong. A sub that warns of the consequences of believing the wrong thing is r/WinStupidPrizes, while r/iamverysmart showcases people trying too hard to look smart. Warning: before entering this sub, prepare for instantaneous coffee / keyboard interfacing.

#E (letter)
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

You may encounter subreddits with nothing but [the letter E in their titles](https://www.reddit.com/r/eeee/comments/7nfb3l/status_of_re_subreddits/) in various quantities. These actually fall under misleading subreddit titles as the “r” in the sub title needs to be read out loud to denote they all relate to the [gaming term “Reeee”](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/reeeeeee) \- a squeal of outrage or anguish.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/AVoid5 is a community that can post anything as long as the letter E is entirely absent. Or should I have said “totally missing”?

#ELI5
::Acronyms and Initials::

“Explain Like I’m Five”. A request for an explanation in simpler terms. Originally sub specific from r/explainlikeimfive now with wider Reddit usage. A short lived rival sub can be found at r/EILI5, described as “Explain It Like I'm 5, but for individuals who believe acronyms should always include nominative case pronouns.” New posts are currently restricted meaning it might be up for adoption now should the pedantry appeal to you. Another dormant rival sub is r/ELIActually5, claiming to be for those too little to understand the big words from ELI5 and will teach you what was too big and scary to understand.

Did you know that you can simplify Wikipedia explanations at [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main\_Page](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) too? Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things. r/explainlikeimfive.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/explainlikeIAmA is a satire sub bordering on role-playing territory with questions like “Explain how to commit a heinous crime of your choosing like you are a cheesy instructional video from the 90s”.  r/explainlikedrcox asks you to “Explain it like you're Doctor Cox” with the explanation “Ok, listen here, pumpkin, if you’re honestly having this much trouble understanding this simple concept, just go ahead and give me a call and I’ll toss you a sympathy throw-down anytime.” Much more sensibly, r/IWantToLearn is all about learning new stuff. Tell them what you want to learn, and let those who came before you help guide you towards success.  r/IWantToTeachaims to connect people who want to teach with people that can learn.

#Emojis
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Reddit in general [does not like emojis](https://i.imgur.com/r6KlE7h.jpg). There are many theories why this is, ranging from *“Reddit is all about written communication and always has been”* to *“Reddit has an incredibly large character limit for most applications, especially when compared to Twitter and standard text messages so we simply don’t have to”* via *“They’re childish”.* and even [*“Some peoaple like to preserve sertain tredition”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ommz6b/comment/h5m1d6t/) \[sic\]. I even read somewhere that it might even be contempt for the laziness of using emojis by those of the generation that had to be inventive with making text-based pictures (emoticons).

* **An actual, not spurious, reason**

Emojis can make life difficult for those relying on software to read text on a page to them out loud. One real issue for those Redditors who use such screen readers is the literal interpretation of smileys, leading to the possibility of hearing gems such as *Stacey posts "OMG shocked emoji I just bought the cutest handbag handbag emoji from Coach dollar sign emoji eyeballs emoji dollar sign emoji eyeballs emoji handbag emoji I can't wait to show everyone at this Sunday's brunch French toast emoji mimosa emoji martini emoji Blessed! praying hands emoji upside down smile emoji”*. Reading out emoticons such as (ಠ\_ಠ) (the look of disapproval) is even worse.

This brings up other issues such as the meaning of some emojis being lost in screen reader translation. Seeing the Red Flag emoji 🚩on a relationship advice post will be obvious to most that they’re giving a warning that something’s not right, but I’ve been informed that a screen reader reads 🚩 as "triangular flag on pole" (unless that's been changed) with no mention of the colour, defeating the whole purpose of the emoji. Using euphemistic emojis like 🍆 might also cause confusion…

* **Also, there’s the platform problem…**

We don’t all browse Reddit in the same way. Some use desktop, some use tablets, some use smartphones. Some use different versions of the website, some use the official app for their particular device, some use one of the many third-party browsers or apps. Some use sparkly new cutting-edge devices, others use their ancient creaky old faithful faded beige noise machines. All this can cause some real communication problems as licensing issues often mean that different platforms have [different emoji packages](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/516048/22-emojis-look-completely-different-different-phones) \- and that doesn’t take into account the many devices that just can’t display them at all and just substitute some Unicode instead.

A question recently asked was “What’s up with people commenting “img” repeatedly in wallstreetbets?” with a [link to this post](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rwsj1o/i_am_neither_bull_nor_bear_i_am_ape/hrdrk5k). Some subreddits give you the ability to select premade images or gifs as an image reaction comment using the official app, and the platform OP was viewing Reddit on presumably didn’t support them and substituted “img” instead. Here's what it looks like on the [official Reddit app](https://i.imgur.com/Wzte5xB.png), but here it is on [Old Reddit](https://i.imgur.com/Fli7hcu_d.webp?maxwidth=760&fidelity=grand) and here it is on [New Reddit](https://i.imgur.com/jx02Nlr_d.webp?maxwidth=760&fidelity=grand).

It appears that the private message facility on the Reddit app [doesn’t like the official emotes either](https://i.redd.it/kakttip5nvv81.jpg), and neither do some [other apps](https://i.imgur.com/KWwyGDN_d.webp?maxwidth=760&fidelity=grand).

* **Serious talk on a fun ephemeral.**

Google: "Why does Reddit hate emojis" and you'll get a flood of responses. Reddit, as you would expect, takes this matter Very Seriously Indeed as evidenced by this small handful of debates from various subs over the years:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/8mwc6h/no\_emojis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/8mwc6h/no_emojis/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/has3sd/why\_does\_everyone\_hate\_emojis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/has3sd/why_does_everyone_hate_emojis/)

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2172px/why\_does\_reddit\_hate\_emoticons/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2172px/why_does_reddit_hate_emoticons/)

But by far my favourite explanations are these two opposing but [very well thought out viewpoints from our sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/t7town/comment/hzmnidx/).

* **Reddit is strange like that.**

I have asked and searched and asked again about why Reddit in particular is known for [emoji hate](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicallythetruth/comments/pz5csp/what_does_represent_to_you/), but the only thing even close to a definitive answer I ever saw was *“Because some time ago, a subreddit that once started as a joke became out of hand and now a lot of redditors have the "emojis are bad" mindset.”* A good humoured take on the subject is [to allow 5 emojis](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmojiPolice/comments/fxyhw6/helo_newcomers_please_read_this_post/) before calling the r/EmojiPolice, though you will probably get called out on anything more than one and I’m not entirely sure on their status or mandate in any event…

Whatever the reason, the practical upshot of this is basically [people either love emojis or hate them](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/8k04ub/people_should_use_emojis_on_reddit/), so to be safe, limit yourself to one at the end of your post, or better still, go back in time and use text-based emoticons. You won’t be admonished for using :) or :D if you’re feeling particularly cheeky. It’s worth mentioning that although we all use Reddit, the tones of our subreddits are really different from each other. r/aww sees a lot of emoji usage compared to, say, r/askreddit, and r/askhistorians would probably collapse at seeing one in their sub.

* **Redditors will Reddit…**

All that said, there is *absolutely no rule on Reddit banning emojis.* You use them wherever and whenever you like. This is Reddit. You can do whatever you want. And if some people downvote an emoji-laden comment, again, this is Reddit and they can do whatever they want. So with that in mind, here’s a [Copypasta which everyone will hate](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/7l0pin/every_emoji_in_emoji10/) and if that isn’t enough, a resource of more emojis than anyone could ever possibly need can be found at [https://emojipedia.org](https://emojipedia.org/).

However, I don’t advise you ever comment !emojify anywhere on Reddit without expecting consequences.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

We even have r/emojisonreddit, r/emojipasta and r/EmojiPolice for your amusement.

#Emoticons
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

We have already established that in general, Reddit does not like emojis, but prefers the old-school Unicode-based Emoticon. An emoticon is a typographic display of a facial representation, used to convey emotion in a text only medium. Like so: ;-) or if you’re feeling really fancy, the look of disapproval (ಠ\_ಠ) or “Lenny Face," ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Useful lists of text-based emoticons to copy and paste are:

* [https://textfac.es](https://textfac.es/)
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_emoticons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/2lofij/ᕕ\_ಠ\_ಠ\_ᓄ\_collection\_of\_text\_emoticons\_updated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/2lofij/%E1%95%95_%E0%B2%A0_%E0%B2%A0_%E1%93%84_collection_of_text_emoticons_updated/)

Some of these are going to be trial and error; some will work and others won’t. So remember: 🤭 = bad, but Reddit loves emoticons. Why? Don't ASCII me. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  r/emoticons.

#Eponymous Laws
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

These are laws, principles, adages, and other succinct observations or predictions named after a person. My current favourite is [Muphry’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muphry%27s_law):  *If you write anything criticizing editing or proofreading, there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written,* which itself is a deliberate misspelling of the more famous [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law): *Anything that can go wrong will go wrong*.

One that is particularly suited to Reddit is [Cunningham’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham#Cunningham%27s_Law) where Ward Cunningham proposed the idea: "The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer.", referring to the observation that people are quicker to correct a wrong answer than to answer a question.

Perhaps the most common of the Eponymous Laws that applies to Reddit is [Poe’s Law](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw), where satirical expressions of extremism online are hard to distinguish from genuine ones. r/religiousfruitcake focuses on people who take religion to absurd, terrible and crazy extremes, but is also [rife with glorious examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/religiousfruitcake/comments/pza88q/dinosaurs_didnt_exist/) of people falling for the many parodies of religious fundamentalism. Did upwards of 4.5k upvoters and 280 comments *really* miss that the image included Godzilla? That surely was a candidate for r/woooosh.

For some years now, I’ve had several attempts at instigating Internet Adages under the uninspiring title “Llama’s Law”. You won’t be surprised to hear I haven’t been successful.

#ESL
::Acronyms and Initials::

“English as a Second Language”. You may sometimes see this initialism during apologies for stilted language or simple misunderstandings. According to Alexa Internet, as of February 2021 Reddit ranks as the 18th-most-visited website in the world. We are a global community and it stands to reason that many of our users are non-native English speakers.

From 2021, Reddit’s interface [became available in several languages](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/o6ipy5/introducing_reddit_in_new_languages/) in the first phase of our product translation in German, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

#ETA; Edit:
::Acronyms and Initials::

“Edited To Add”. Sometimes just “Edit:”. Used if you go back and change something in your post or comment. There is a long time limit on going back to edit your posts or comments, however you cannot edit the title of a post at any time.

You have 3 minutes to edit your comment before it will show on New Reddit that you made an edit to it. After 3 minutes, there will be an asterisk (\*) in the line where it says how long ago you made the comment. Here's an example of [how it looks to other users](https://i.imgur.com/s5jR8pb_d.webp?maxwidth=760&fidelity=grand) if you edit your post. There's such a thing as "ninja editing" which, if it is edited quick enough after posting doesn't declare the edit.

Reddit, as you would expect, is [divided](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2rfe78/why_do_people_clarify_the_reason_they_edited/) on the merits of telling everyone [you made an edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ske1j3/why_do_people_type_edit_if_they_edit_their/). Quite apart from the fact it’s [in the Reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette), it’s just good form to state your reason for any editing of posts. Even if it was just edited for spelling, a simple "Edit: typo" or “ETA: typo” will help explain.

* **A good reason to edit**

Sometimes you might want to add more information to your initial post or comment. Don’t do this by replying to your own comment as it will become out of order in the thread and as *The Average Redditor*™ doesn’t look at usernames, confusing to all. If you have another thing to add to your original post or comment, you should edit it and say "Edit: I want to add..." or something along those lines.

* **A bad reason to edit and a fun reason to edit**

Editing a post or comment after the event to deliberately change the meaning and cause confusion is called an [“Edit Trap”](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/rf35kh/why_ppl_use_phrases_like_edit_spelling_etc_in/hobuq7z/) and is usually done to stealthily win arguments so later readers don’t see what really went down. This isn’t very nice so don’t do it.

Editing a post or comment after the event to deliberately change the meaning with the participation of the [other users in the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/fo6pki/ask_me_a_question_then_edit_your_question_to_make/) can, however, be fun and [really quite bizarre](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/cufioi/ask_me_something_and_then_edit_the_question_after/).

#Euphemism
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A Euphemism is the substitution of an inoffensive expression for one considered offensive or explicit, used online to bypass profanity or other moderation filters on social media platforms. To evade algorithms that hunt down forbidden words, users of platforms like TikTok employ cryptic synonyms. In this way, ‘dead’ becomes ‘unalive’, and the pandemic becomes ‘panini’ or ‘Panda Express’. A technology journalist, Taylor Lorenz, drew attention to the trend in April 2022 [in the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/08/algospeak-tiktok-le-dollar-bean/), calling the vocabulary “Algospeak”.

Back in the day, I recall using “1337spk” or “leetspeak” to get around context-blind content moderation filters; not to look cool or anything, but to get around [The Scunthorpe Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_problem). This phenomenon was named for a time in 1996 when AOL's profanity filter prevented residents of several English towns and counties - among them Scunthorpe, Penistone and Middlesex - from creating accounts with AOL because it matched strings within the town names to "banned" words in their algorithm.

Tailoring language to avoid scrutiny predates the Internet by a very long way. In the first three centuries of persecution, early Christians used [the highly mystical Ichthus fish symbol](https://earlychurchhistory.org/christian-symbols/the-fish-symbol-ichthus/) to secretly identify themselves. Many superstitions and profanities still used today grew around avoiding saying the devil’s name, while people living in repressive regimes developed code words to discuss taboo topics. Nowadays, we use emojis as euphemisms too. If you see 🍆, for instance, you can be fairly certain you aren’t about to see a recipe for [Baba Ganoush](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetable-recipes/baba-ganoush/).

Other methods of tailored language involve deliberate misspellings as in “ducking” or the replacing of letters with other characters as in “b@“, or even both as in “pr0n”. Portmanteau words include “scamdemic” and even contractions are used such as “dbag”. John Peel (the late radio DJ and music historian from the U.K.) used the term “Phonetic Spelling” to describe the song titles of the 70's pop band [Slade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slade), who had a habit of deliberately misspelling their song titles e.g. ["Cum On, Feel The Noize"](https://youtu.be/sKYYPh8rvQU) (I should note here that in the U.K. at least, their usage of the word “cum” predates the modern version, being just a quirky alternate spelling with no sexual connotation).

There has long been a trend in the internet community to misspell words as a means of comic emphasis, such as "You were pwned!" (as a variant of owned, which is slang for 'to kick someone's ass') or "Best thread evar!" Known as “divergent spelling”, marketers also use this in the intentional misspelling of business names to attract attention.

Euphemisms are especially common in online radicalised or harmful communities. Anti-vaccine groups on Facebook have their own language while pro-eating disorder and self-harm communities have long adopted variations on moderated words to evade restrictions. Many communities on Reddit have their own euphemisms too. In the advice communities on Reddit, it’s normal to say “SA” instead of “sexual assault,” and in many Religious subs, people will say “G\_d” rather than “God”. Other communities will have their own euphemisms which you will no doubt discover.

#European Subreddits
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Contrary to some belief, Reddit is not [exclusively populated by Americans](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/eb9r3m/did_redditors_always_assume_other_reddit_users/).

There are also a wide range of location-specific political subreddits and [this old list](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditlists/comments/josdr/list_of_political_subreddits/) is a good start to finding them.

#“Everyone on Reddit is a...”
::Memes and Trends::

A phrase posted in the sense of a Meme when one of Reddit’s generalisations is proved wrong. Or right. Usernames on Reddit are rarely noticed, and even when they are they don’t tend to give anything away about the user, so some of the most common meme assumptions are:

* “Everyone’s a white American male in their 20s.” Understandable, but wrong.
* “Everyone’s an alt.” OK. It does feel that way sometimes.
* “Everyone’s a secret Russian hacker bot.” Overcautious? Maybe?

Reddit loves generalisations. Reddit loves memes. Here, we have both! But if you want actual statistics, [there are some interesting ones here from 2020](https://www.alphr.com/demographics-reddit/).

#“Everyone on Reddit is a bot except you.”
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

[A phrase](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/348vlx/what_bot_accounts_on_reddit_should_people_know/) derived from one older than Reddit. The likelihood is that it originated from early Internet chat rooms such as IRC. When you joined an Internet Relay Channel, you could see a list of users who were already there and at least one was an admin bot. Along with novelty bots who would respond to specific phrases or questions, it was entirely possible to join a channel and chat with several users there, all bots except you.

Sometimes it seems that way on Reddit too, and someone will post this phrase. A correct reply would be HA HA, NO BOTS HERE, FELLOW FLESH PERSON. Or you could use Markdown Text to create tiny text saying “beep boop”; the response given by many Reddit bots.

The suspicion that Redditors are mostly bots is not [entirely unfounded](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/j5lai1/this_user_is_posting_with_gpt3_uthegentlemetre/g7xqmn2/) as in 2020, it was discovered a GPT-3 bot had [been posting in one subreddit for a whole week](https://www.unilad.co.uk/technology/an-ai-was-posting-on-reddit-for-a-whole-week-and-things-got-dark/).

#eyebleach
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

The loveliest sub on Reddit. Named for a term used when you see an image, subreddit or webpage that's so terrible the only logical thing to do is pour bleach in your eyes in the hopes that it will cleanse your corneas, r/eyebleach is full of cute things to "bleach" your eyes with after you've seen something nasty. The metaphor of [bleaching one's eyes](https://imgur.com/EhSiwGC) has been used for a long time in popular TV shows and films through colloquial expressions like "clawing one's eyes out".

You can even summon the EyeBleacherBot by commenting the username u/EyeBleacherBot. Typing ‘unsee juice’, ‘bleach’ or ‘what a terrible day to have eyes’ can also work, but as with all bots, it may not have access to all subreddits if the mods have banned bots from commenting.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

…and Reddit is, well, Reddit, the most disturbing sub on Reddit is named to be as close as possible to the spelling of r/eyebleach so as to be intentionally misleading. In a splendid example of the adage “a little thing can make a big difference”, the omission of the first letter of the alphabet turns the loveliest sub into its exact opposite. ALWAYS check the spelling when anyone links to r/eyebleach. If it isn’t spelled with an ‘a’, DO NOT click the link. You have been warned.
