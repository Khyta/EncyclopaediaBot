Title: About
Flair: Meta
Content: The “About” tab on mobile contains essential information for the sub you are visiting. Also known as Sidebar on desktop. Always read the rules before commenting or posting on an unfamiliar Subreddit. These will be found in the Sidebar (on mobile this will be the About tab, Menu tab (where there is one) and Community Info found in the three dot “hamburger” post overflow menu top RH corner of your screen), any pinned posts (these will have a lime green ‘pin’ icon on the top corner and will show on top when you sort the Subreddit by ‘Hot’) and Wiki (where there is one). Here’s our [comprehensive guide to finding a subreddit’s rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/).

Some subs will have an F.A.Q. List, and many will have a Wiki. Unfortunately for mobile users, a subreddit Wiki is currently not compatible with the official Reddit app. Links given to any part of a Wiki will do one of three things to an app user:

1. Prompt one of the many “this subreddit does not exist” pop-ups.
2. Default to the very top of the wiki regardless of where on the page the link should send you.
3. [Mess up the format completely](https://i.redd.it/944m5oc3wli81.png).

However, opening the Wiki in a browser will work, though not an ideal solution. Very much not ideal solution.

Title: Absolute Unit
Flair: Animals
Content: It's as large as life and twice as natural! If it’s big, it can be described as a unit. If it’s really big, it’s an absolute unit. Unless it’s a cat, [in which case it’s a chonk](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/chonk-oh-lawd-he-comin). Test update.

Memes, just like every other joke format, don’t exist in a vacuum, which is why being aware of their origins is crucial. While we are happy to use phrases like this as an affectionate way to refer to a large, round animal or object, its origin is far less innocent, being an image of a [large man standing behind the Queen Of England](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/absolute-unit), with the caption, “In awe at the size of this lad. Absolute unit.” Despite having the picture on their heading, [r/AbsoluteUnits](https://www.reddit.com/r/AbsoluteUnits/) are looking for animals mostly, particularly cute animals which happen to be very large. Only public figures are allowed; no harassment, creep-shots, witch-hunts or fat-shaming is allowed.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[r/TinyUnits](https://www.reddit.com/r/TinyUnits/) is a chilled out place for sharing videos, gifs, and images of tiny animals, insects & random objects you find pretty awesome.

Title: Accidental Alt
Flair: Meta
Content: It is possible to have an accidental account on Reddit! This comes as a shock to many people when they discover they’ve inadvertently created a different account by clicking "sign in with Google/Apple". Doing that creates a new, or alternate account (Alt) with a random username, usually consisting of [two unrelated words joined with an underscore or hyphen, followed by a random number](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/n75l53/my_icon_info/).

These automatically generated usernames can be changed within 30 days of account creation by going to your profile where a prompt should appear asking if you would like to keep or change the username. If the prompt does not show up, you may have accidentally chosen to keep the username and you would have to create a new account in order to have another username.

Creating an Alt can happen easily by accident, especially if you're logged in with Chrome, or sometimes on iOS mobile by following a generic link like: [https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile](https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile). To get back to a normal account, stop using the "sign in with Google/Apple ID" option and instead type out your usual username and password combinations.

Title: accidentalswastika
Flair: Missing flair
Content: A link posted when you find an unintentional swastika shape in logos and designs of all kinds. Before posting there, please check the Forbidden Post List at [https://old.reddit.com/r/accidentalswastika/](https://old.reddit.com/r/accidentalswastika/) first, because some Swastikas aren’t unintentional or even malicious. *Sauwastika* are ancient religious symbols used as 卐 by Hindu/Jain (among others) and as 卍 by Buddhists (among others), and until recently, the [“Hakaristi”](http://www.strangehistory.net/2015/02/24/good-swastikas-hakaristi/) was a symbol used by [Finland’s Air Force](https://www.dw.com/en/finlands-air-force-removes-the-swastika-from-logo-after-almost-a-century/a-54020470). Indeed, the swastika shape has a [fascinating history worldwide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika); Context, as always, is everything. [r/accidentalswastika](https://www.reddit.com/r/accidentalswastika/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[r/hailhortler](https://www.reddit.com/r/hailhortler/) is for deliberate attempts at drawing Nazi Swastikas, i.e. the “Hakenkreuz” (hook-cross), that have failed somewhat, and [r/beholdthemasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/beholdthemasterrace/) mocks supremacy according to their sidebar criteria.

Title: Achievements
Flair: Meta
Content: On some subreddits, you might notice you have [mystery awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/t2z8xm/what_is_this_award_for/) which add a little sprite next to your username, which, once clicked reveal titles such as "Avid Voter" or "Prolific Commenter".

These aren’t [Awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/qbb173/comment/hhhj0ui/) or even [Trophies](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/qbb173/comment/hhu4tdu/) in the traditional Reddit sense, but are actually [Achievements](https://i.redd.it/1p0sqrimwwr81.jpg) automatically conferred on anyone who contributes to a [powered-up community](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/qbb173/comment/hhqwo3k/).

There are two types of achievements; [the first](https://i.redd.it/3cyg5erh9xr81.jpg) are given to anyone posting or commenting in a powered up community, and [the second](https://i.redd.it/2rikg1iw9xr81.jpg) are for those who do the powering-up for that community. You can see yours by either clicking on the icons next to your username or by viewing your profile (on mobile; I don’t know if it works on desktop) while you’re in that community.

You won’t see these achievements outside the powered-up subreddit either next to your username or on your profile. If the subreddit loses its powerups, your achievements will also disappear.

There is one acronym you should always [report immediately](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/qyxjyk/how_to_report/) if you see it being used and that is KYS. Originating in gaming communities, this is shorthand for “kill your self \[sic\]” as an “edgy” way to say “fuck you”. However, Reddit believes that suicide is a very serious subject and this kind of language should not be taken lightly. Inviting someone to commit suicide is against our code of conduct and may well incur a ban.

Title: Activity
Flair: Meta
Content: Part of your Inbox (the envelope icon), and also known as Notifications, this lists recent replies to any of your posts or comments. Also refers to your Reddit Account Activity, which you can check at [https://www.reddit.com/account-activity](https://www.reddit.com/account-activity).

You might not know that Reddit shows other users if you are currently active or not. Here is how to hide yourself [on mobile](https://i.redd.it/rsa2mt5nluk61.gif) and here’s how to hide yourself [on desktop](https://i.redd.it/8hggkgtnluk61.gif).

A question I’m often asked is “Can others see my reddit activity such as upvoted / downvoted posts, saved posts or followed subreddits?” The good news is that nobody (mods or other redditors) can see what you upvoted, downvoted, saved or unsaved, neither can they see the subs you have visited, joined or left.

I'm unaware of any way that people can tell you've visited a sub if you've never posted/commented in it. However, Reddit will show which subs you're active in. I don't know what the criteria are to be considered "active," but I'm guessing you have to have posted or commented in it at least once or twice. You have options in your privacy settings that can limit some of this information from being given out [under Preferences --> Privacy Options](https://i.redd.it/eibwgjlus2s61.jpg) or go to User Settings --> Profile --> Active in communities visibility --> Disable. In Old Reddit, the setting is here: [https://old.reddit.com/prefs/](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/)

If you're anxious about what others can see on your account, you're welcome to create a throwaway ‘Alt’ account. You can use that account to visit subs that you might not want to show up in your original account. It is not linked to your original account and it's as anonymous as you want it to be. Multiple accounts are allowed as long as they don't engage in vote manipulation or ban evasion from a sub.
