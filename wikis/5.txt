#Markdown Text
::General Guides::

Used in formatting Reddit posts to include **bold,** *italic,* ~~strikethrough~~ text etc. “New Reddit” for desktop or mobile browser has a “Fancy Pants” (rich text format) Editor, where you can choose various options from icons below the text entry field, which often doesn’t work properly. You can instead switch to “Markdown” and [there’s a useful list of commands here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown) for reference.

We have a new sister sub specifically to practice using this called r/LearnToReddit; a place to learn and practice using Reddit in regards to posting different post types, commenting, adding and editing flairs and so on, where the community will feedback on your post to let you know how you did, share tips, or help you get it right next time.

There’s also an incredibly useful tool at [https://redditpreview.com](https://redditpreview.com/). You could even use a sub called r/test, but you won’t get any help or feedback there if things don’t quite work out.

[Another Markdown primer is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6ewgt/reddit_markdown_primer_or_how_do_you_do_all_that/) and there’s another version [of the same information here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cw70q/reddit_comment_formatting/).

#“May I see it?”
::Jargon and Slang::

An innocuous phrase that is not quite how it appears. Originating in [The Simpsons S07E21](https://youtu.be/4jXEuIHY9ic), this is a response often given to an absurd story in order to prompt [a Steamed Hams script Comment Chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/ic9keu/an_oral_history_of_steamed_hams_the_funniest/g21msm0/). Reddit loves this particular pop-culture reference, and [saying anything in the script](https://mixels-lucky-screenshots.fandom.com/wiki/Steamed_Hams/Transcript) should start a Comment Chain or Copypasta.

The episode entitled [“22 Short Films About Springfield”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22_Short_Films_About_Springfield) was named after the arthouse biographical narrative movie “Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould”, and “Steamed Hams”, originally called “Chalmers vs. Skinner,” was one of several interconnecting vignettes depicting various moments in the lives of the titular town's residents, with the Simpson family (normally the main focus of their show) being reduced to supporting characters when featured.

Lasting just under three minutes, the sketch had an [enormous cultural impact](https://mashable.com/article/the-simpsons-steamed-hams-meme-origin), and 25 years after it was first broadcast, [the cast and crew](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/steamed-hams-at-25-simpsons-cast-and-crew-attempt-to-decipher-classic-moments-extraordinary-cult-following-4153712/) were still quite taken aback with how viral it became - [before “being viral” was even a thing](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/simpsons-steamed-hams-oral-history).

There’s a Subreddit devoted to its memes at r/SteamedHams, and Simpsons references [range far and wide across much of Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/t/the_simpsons/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/TheSimpsons is just one of the many subreddits devoted to the eponymous animated parody of American culture, society and television, and others include:

* r/Simpsons
* r/unexpectedsimpsons
* r/TheSimpsonsMemes
* r/simpsonsshitposting
* r/SimpsonsFaces

Video games based on the show also have their own subreddits:

* r/tappedout
* r/SimpsonsHitAndRun

And because The Simpsons has been more reliable at predicting future events than any fortune teller ever, we also have the mind bending r/simpsonsdidit. And talking of [Copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/CopyPastas/comments/7vaza6/steamed_hams_full_transcript/)…

#“Maybe the real treasure was the friends we made along the way".
::Jargon and Slang::

A phrase posted when people bemoan the fact that they’ve spent a great deal of effort to find what they've been led to believe would be valuable, only to find out that the value isn't what they expected. A long-standing movie trope called [the “Worthless Treasure Twist”](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessTreasureTwist), this meme is [seriously clichéd](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/maybe-the-real-treasure-was-the-friends-we-made-along-the-way), making it an ideal Reddit response, often prompting a Comment Chain where ‘X’ and ‘Y’ refer to whatever the post was about:

* Maybe the real X was the Y we made along the way
* The real X is always in the comments
* The real X was inside you all along

This is just one example of many phrasal templates known as “[Snowclone](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/7/#wiki_snowclone)”.

#Medical Advice on Reddit
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Social media isn’t usually the place for sound advice on real-world problems, but Reddit does have more than its fair share of communities based on and around medical issues, including:

* r/AskDocs (General Health Issues & Questions)
* r/Medical (Questions about medical practices & procedures)
* r/medical_advice (General Health Issues & Questions)
* r/healthcare (General Health Issues & Questions)
* r/Health (A science-based community to discuss health news and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic)
* r/UKHealthcare (A sub dedicated to healthcare in the UK)
* r/DiagnoseMe (General Health Issues & Questions)
* r/Dentistry (Questions about dental procedures and dental health)

There are many subreddits offering information and advice on specific illnesses, ailments, conditions, syndromes and other medical issues, and also some general ones such as r/public_health which hosts discussions on ever area of medicine, journal articles, texts, public health policy, global health, and ethics in public medicine; r/globalhealth, dedicated to healthcare discussions worldwide, and [many health-related subreddits too](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/wiki/health). Don’t forget - always check the sidebar (or About tab on mobile) when you’re in a sub for lists of similar subreddits.

You should note that advice given on Reddit does not constitute professional medical advice. Advice is either meant for interest only, in an unofficial capacity, or to help point you in the right direction. Assessment, diagnosis and treatment recommendations are not possible, and all suggestions as such are only speculative opinions. Most advice will be USA-centric unless stated otherwise.

#Memes
::Memes and Trends::

Reddit is still the internet. Memes that are “out there” are in here too, perhaps even more so as many originated on the myriad [Reddit meme subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/t/memes/). In fact, memes and the discussions thereof can be found [widely throughout Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/t/internet_culture_and_memes/).

Memes are supposed to be used repeatedly. Things like [“Woman Yelling at Cat”](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/dt5ow3/what_is_going_on_with_the_pointing_crying_woman/), “Don’t Ever Talk to [Me and My Son Again”](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/456phs/what_is_this_dont_talk_to_me_or_my_son_ever_again/), the astronaut-with-a-gun [“Always Has Been”](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/h12fll/what_is_going_on_with_the_always_has_been_meme/) and the cartoon [“Me and the Boys”](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/bvuwfh/whats_up_with_those_me_and_the_boys_memes/) are only funny because of the variety of ways they're used. So, use them. Use them widely and appropriately. There are too many dedicated Meme subs of varying quality to list here, but a good start would be:

* r/memes \- with 15 million subscribers and counting. Has a large karma threshold.
* r/meme \- fairly liberal but all posts must be original memes.
* r/AdviceAnimals \- consisting of two-line jokes over a single-panel reusable character template.
* r/PrequelMemes \- for memes of the Star Wars Prequels.
* r/terriblefacebookmemes \- featuring the worst memes ever seen.
* r/ComedyCemetery \- ...where jokes go to die. Stuff intended to be funny, but... isn't.
* r/dankmemes \- for sarcastic expressions that have lost their comedic value or intentionally inexplicable clichés. Has a huge karma threshold.
* r/SpecialSnowflake \- for people hoping to post in dankmemes despite not meeting the 2500 post karma threshold.
* r/artmemes \- for vaguely humorous captions added to art.
* r/HistoryMemes \- memes related to history in some way, shape or form.
* r/deepfriedmemespart2 \- for low resolution images with artefacts and filters galore.
* r/MemeRestoration \- for images with maximum resolution, minimal filters.

You can always try to start your own meme. Tardar Sauce, a.k.a [Grumpy Cat](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/10bu17/meet_grumpy_cat/) became world famous after first appearing on two glorious [posts on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/10cfbf/since_everyone_liked_grumpy_cat_here_are_a_few/), while the sinister-looking [Disaster-Girl](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/disaster-girl) was even able to [pay off her student loans](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/30/disaster-girl-meme-nft-sale-zoe-roth) after becoming an Internet meme. Good places to start would be:

* r/MemeTemplatesOfficial \- to post your templates or request one instead; some NSFW.
* r/FreshMemeTemplates \- some NSFW.
* r/MemeEconomy \- for trading new meme templates.

Always read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) before commenting, posting or using the resources from an unfamiliar Subreddit. Most meme subreddits have a high karma requirement, and some even say in their rules that they will block anyone who asks about it.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

“Antimemes” lead you to expect a joke but instead you receive deadpan reality in a clever or funny way, and r/antimeme is the place to set up [jokes that have no punchline](https://i.redd.it/bo92r68eqos81.png), as is r/AntiMemes. And r/meormyson is for those of you who don't want people talking to you or your son ever again.

#Mental Health on Reddit
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Social media isn’t usually the place for sound advice on real-world problems, but for some people struggling with mental health issues, often the only contact they have with people outside their immediate circle is on the internet. Reddit has its serious side, and we have many communities that focus on mental health topics ranging from ones for those that suffer from some sort of mental health issue themselves, to those that want resources on how to support their friends and family in all kinds of situations, through to discussing neurodiversity, and of course places where you can go just for some positivity and good vibes. These include:

* r/depression \- support for anyone struggling with a depressive disorder, because nobody should be alone in a dark place.
* r/Anxiety \- discussion and support for sufferers and loved ones of any anxiety disorder.
* r/sad \- if you're sad, depressed or just need a hug. Also r/Sadness
* r/neurodiversity \- for the social and political discussion of neurological and psychological differences of the neurodivergent.
* r/BipolarReddit \- information about bipolar disorder and associated issues. A subreddit to share information about who you are, how you think, and what helps you cope in life.
* r/OCD \- dedicated to discussion, articles, and images regarding Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.
* r/ADHD \- a sub where over a million users say they 'feel at home' and 'finally found a place where people understand them'.
* r/askatherapist \- ask a therapist or mental health professional on Reddit. This sub does not in any way replace seeing a therapist.
* r/zenhabits \- a self-improvement sub that focuses on concepts like meditation, productivity, happiness and other aspects of self-improvement.
* r/howtonotgiveafuck \- a subreddit dedicated to the subtle art of simply giving less of a fuck about anything, with positive results.
* **Something a little more specific**

r/mentalhealth is the primary subreddit to discuss, vent, support and share information about mental health, illness and wellness, and for more targeted or specific discussion or help, an excellent place to start [is this long and varied list of subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/comments/jd2h5i/mental_health_change_your_life_subreddit_list/).

Always look in a subreddit’s [Sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/7/#wiki_sidebar) as there is often a list of links to other relevant subs or other useful information there, such as this list of [coping strategies for ADHD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ioi1my/i_went_through_700_reddit_comments_and_collected/). Talking of which, there’s also a useful list of [ADHD related subreddits here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/comments/mzm6ag/a_list_of_adhd_related_subreddits/) and a general list of subreddits for [advice or support on depression or other mental health issues here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/comments/dmic6o/advice_mental_health_subreddits/).

Related issues come up in all kinds of subreddits, and in 2021, a user in r/explainlikeimfiveasked the question [is "neurodivergent" a categorical replacement of the term "mental illness(es)"?](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/mnwe0w/eli5_is_neurodivergent_a_categorical_replacement/) which prompted a short but interesting discussion.

* **Suicidal thoughts and ideation**

r/SuicideWatch is Reddit’s foremost sub to give peer support for anyone struggling with suicidal thoughts. They give responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to their users, and even have clear guidelines about the [accidental validation of both direct and indirect incitement of suicide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cz6nfd/new_wiki_on_how_to_avoid_accidentally_encouraging/)

When you see a post or comment about suicidal feelings in a community, it can be overwhelming, and you may feel like you don’t know what to do. But you can help, and there are [resources on Reddit available for you and the person you are worried about](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513931-What-do-I-do-if-someone-talks-about-seriously-hurting-themselves-or-is-considering-suicide-).

When you tap the three dots in the [top right corner of a user’s profile page](https://i.redd.it/jqtjfb501ox81.jpg) there is an option called 'get them help and support'. On selecting this, Reddit sends out an automated message with some suicide helpline phone numbers and links.

The moderators of r/SuicideWatch maintain a list of FAQs, information, and resources at r/SWResources and a worldwide [list of hotlines](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines). If you’ve lost someone to suicide, r/SuicideBereavement is there for you.

* **Reddit is not enough**

Reddit is a network for sharing experiences. It is ideal for crowdsourcing other users’ experiences and the immediate need to know that others have experienced - and even overcome - similar struggles to encourage each other and overcome the feeling of incomprehension and helplessness at one’s situation. However, as useful as validation and encouragement like this can be, Reddit - or any other social media outlet - is no substitute for professional help which should be sought as soon as possible.

#Meta
::Jargon and Slang::

A link or phrase nothing to do with [Facebook’s name change](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/qjwg48/facebook_is_now_meta_and_it_wants_to_monetize/) but one posted when a comment or post increasingly becomes self-referential, for example: Reddit discussing itself, a meme about memes, a conversation on the nature of conversations and so on. Meta refers to the idea of something being about itself, of which r/metamemes is a perfect example, specialising in memes about Reddit. Also: r/meta; It's So Meta Even This Acronym...

If you feel like you kind of *get* a Reddit comment but don’t quite know why, always think 3 things:

1. Is this a Reddit meta joke?
2. Have I watched the US version of *The Office*? Have I watched *Parks and Recreation*? Or *The Simpsons*? Any Marvel thing ever?  *Letterkenny*? Something in the *Lord of the Rings* universe, anything related to *Harry Potter* or whatever Netflix show is hot this season?
3. Is this the only other human with my sense of humour?

The answer is always 1 and probably involves a lot of 2. Welcome to Reddit!

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Another form of meta that Reddit has embraced wholeheartedly is the recursive image, or [mise-en-abîme](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100201557): a formal technique of placing a copy of an image within itself in a way that suggests an infinitely recurring sequence. In film theory and literary theory, it refers to the technique of inserting a story within a story. In r/pics back in 2019, a Redditor made a [fairly poignant post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/aggom4/my_mom_painted_this_and_said_no_one_would_like_it/), and because Redditors will Reddit, they rallied together in support to create what turned out to be a glorious meta [collaborative art project](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/reddit-painting-droste-effect-1445749).

This type of recursion is also known as the [Droste Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droste_effect). Named for the picture on a Dutch [brand of Cocoa Powder](https://www.reddit.com/r/2healthbars/comments/7kv3tp/the_droste_effect/), find other examples at r/DrosteEffect, r/2healthbars, and r/Recursion. Related to this are r/FibonacciAsFuck which is dedicated to all things Fibonacci Spirals, an amazing shape that forms when the [golden ratio](https://i.redd.it/2ppmd01cdks81.jpg) is applied and r/FractalGifs, self-repeating and infinite zoom animations about Fractals.

And because [cat](https://rathergood.com/2015/09/09/the-internet-is-made-of-cats/), does anyone remember [The Infinite Cat Project](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/dandbf/til_of_the_infinite_cat_project_starting_in_2003/)? I remember submitting one of my black cat looking at a picture of himself which I entitled “Staring into the Void” but I don’t think it was successful. And now I don’t have a cat to submit.

#Misleading Subreddit Titles
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Not every Subreddit is as it would at first appear to be. There are many subs with misleading titles which I have listed at [Navigating Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/p8t966/reddit_and_karma_explained/h9ssh6c/). As you would expect, those aren’t the only ones…

* r/PanPorn \- no, not kitchen utensils in an NSFW setting; this sub is for well-used makeup products that have worn down to the packaging: i.e. the pan.
* r/AlzheimersGroup \- people posting a Garfield strip each day as if it were brand new. That’s actually not a strip I’ve seen before. Someone said I have but I don’t think so.
* r/NoPoo \- Potty training? Hardly. This is a place to discuss natural haircare and alternatives to shampoo.
* r/smoking \- for enhancing the flavour of meats and vegetables, not the usage of tobacco.
* r/expectedouija \- nothing supernatural here, only memes about corn. Yes, corn. You know, 🌽. Corn.
* r/CasualCock \- sadly now dormant, this sub featured cocks keeping it casual (with or without their hens).
* r/dikpictures \- to post pics of dik-diks / diks: a type of small antelope.
* r/manholeporn \- a sub for SFW pictures of sewer covers in all their cast iron glory and absolutely no NSFW pictures of man holes.
* r/Gonewilder \- wilder than Gone Wild? Not really; this sub is for Gene Wilder pictures.
* r/bigbustycoons \- someone please resurrect this sub. About public transport, of course.

All have their different origin stories, sometimes in their Sidebar; often lost to the mists of time.

Talking of being misleading, Reddit also has several subreddits with the word “fuck” in their title which have nothing to do with what that word normally means and are not just SFW but as wholesome as fuck - just like r/wholesomeasfuck, r/interestingasfuck, r/FairytaleasFuck, and r/NatureIsFuckingLit.

#\[MLM\]
::Acronyms and Initials::

These three letters have several meanings depending on the subreddit type you are in. MLM on r/antiMLM, r/mlmstories, r/MLM or similar means Multi-Level Marketing. On relationship subs it might refer to Man Loves Man, and \[MLM\] on r/itookapicture (ITAP) means ‘Mona Lisa Monday’. A rule on ITAP is that photos with a primary focus on one person staring, looking or thinking, without any other interesting action are limited to MLM Mondays (Midnight - Midnight, GMT). Please be sure to read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) before posting or commenting in any unfamiliar sub.

---

#Mod
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Short for Moderator. Subreddits each have moderators to keep the content on that sub within the rules and keep order amongst its users. We are all unpaid volunteers. When we speak on formal behalf of our sub, our username will either have the [green word ‘MOD’](https://i.redd.it/9t426rzdogy81.jpg) immediately after, or in older interfaces be green, accompanied by a [green shield](https://i.redd.it/zyx3bgxh4gy81.jpg).

All moderators on Reddit are free to make the rules for the subs we moderate, and can break them just as easily. In our subs, we are [The Law](https://i.redd.it/mnkpgqi99dl81.jpg), but we do have [Moderator Guidelines](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines) and to a lesser extent, [unofficial guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/moddiquette). However, there is nobody “looking over our shoulder” to enforce us to use them, although we are bound to the exact same sitewide restrictions and rules as you are.

Mods are generally the [least popular group of people on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/pexs3i/why_is_there_such_antimod_fervor_on_reddit/) with, I’ll concede, some justification as some are stricter (and less approachable) than others.

* **Who chooses the mods?**

All moderators on Reddit are volunteers. We don’t get paid in any way, shape or form for what we do. No upvotes, Reddit karma, Reddit coins, awards, trophies, pats on the head from Admin; not even dead leaves and gravel thrown at us from that strange guy who lives behind the dumpster at Reddit HQ’s car park. We have no “special hotline” to Admin and have no direct input in official Reddit sitewide policy. We have no special treatment outside our subs. If we ourselves are banned from a subreddit (for instance), we have no recourse either.

We become moderators either by making our own subreddits, taking over an existing but dormant subreddit or simply by being asked to by other mods of a subreddit. This means that ANYONE has the potential to be a mod, and if you are of the opinion that Redditors are a mixed bundle of nice and not-so-nice characters of all ages and levels of maturity, you would be correct in thinking that this also applies to mods. And yes, some of us are nice! Others; maybe not so much. Some of us give the benefit of the doubt and are happy to listen to reasoned apologies. Others; again maybe not so much. Some of us will look at the deeper context before making a carefully considered decision; others may just let their chaotic natures lead them to arbitrary choices, or some may not have time for more than a quick judgment. Whether this is fair or unfair is not under discussion here; it’s just the way it is.

* **A lunch analogy break**

I call this type of arrangement “Spaghetti Management”. The whole plate is spaghetti, but every strand is a complete entity on its own; you don’t know what you’re getting until you’re biting because every strand has a different pliability; some take longer to wind up than others might, some absorb more sauce than others and some may be a lot spicier than the rest.

* **Do mods have to answer to anyone?**

Admin basically let mods run their subs however they like so long as they abide by [the TOU](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-october-15-2020). It is up to the mods if they want to yell at, ignore the concerns of, or even ban someone for whatever reason they want. The subreddit rules are there only as guidelines to the user; they may not be the only criteria a Mod chooses if they want someone out of their sub and in any event, the Mods can ignore them as they see fit.

As with all things, there are usually [two sides to each story](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/pz8mkr/some_things_moderators_wish_redditors_to_know/) (as you will no doubt find out for yourself should you ever create your own subreddit) and most moderators are only looking out for the well-being of their own communities. It may not be clear to you from the outside why you received a ban (for instance), but for all you know, you might have been the hundredth person picked up that day for similar infractions. However, there will be the occasional Mod who treats their sub as their “secret club”, and if they [don’t want you in it](https://youtu.be/OwHGE7uhjco), there’s nothing anyone else can do to stop them.

* **How many mods can a subreddit have?**

So far, [nobody actually knows](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9ctqr4/how_many_mods_can_i_add_in_one_subreddit/), although r/Science has over 1500. Various subs have tried to test the limit over the years, such as:

* r/modlimit
* r/youreamod
* r/modeveryone
* r/FriendsAndShit

The answer to “How many mods *should* a subreddit have?” Is a little different. It really depends on the [overall activity of a sub](https://subredditstats.com/r/NewToReddit) (page views, number of comments, etc) rather than size or subscription numbers. At r/NewToReddit, we probably have more mods than most other subs of the same size, but we try to get at least one mod reply to every post, and there is a lot more “behind the scenes” work with all the guides we write, the encyclopaedia, the wiki, the sister subreddit etc. We also rely on Automod to deal with some of the background stuff too, such as letting a user know if they fell foul of Reddit’s Shadowban algorithm as soon after they post as possible so they can get it sorted out.

In any list of mods, the username at the top will be the Sub Owner / Head Mod, and can remove or curtail the actions of any of the usernames (mods) below. The list of actions [that mods can perform](https://i.redd.it/ive17k5s1hy81.png) is also controlled by those higher on the list, and you can see [here what mods can actually do](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002318552-What-mods-can-do).

While none of the work we do is very important, it is important that we do a great deal of it. [And we do it for free](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/ol341w/getting_started_on_reddit_where_can_i_safely_post/).

#ModerationMediation
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Mediation is a structured, interactive process where an impartial third party assists disputing parties to actively participate in resolving their conflict.  r/ModerationMediation is a subreddit designed to help Reddit users obtain actionable advice surrounding a ban or other moderation action they might have been subject to. They specialise in assisting users in understanding their ban and finding productive avenues to appeal. This is not a subreddit to complain about moderators, as they even help moderators too with particular issues.  r/ModerationMediation.

Before taking an issue directly to them, you should read their:

* [Mission Statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModerationMediation/wiki/mission_statement?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf): What they’re all about.
* [Success Stories and Testimonials](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModerationMediation/wiki/success?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf): Direct links to a curated list of successful threads.
* [Subreddit Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModerationMediation/wiki/subreddit_rules?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf): Please read before commenting.
* [Submission Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModerationMediation/wiki/submission_rules_step1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf): Please read before asking for advice.

Moderators on Reddit are all volunteers. They only speak for the sub or subs they moderate, and outside of their subs are subject to the same rules everyone else is. Reddit has [guidelines for moderators](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines-for-healthy-communities) they are expected to abide by, and [Moddiquette is an informal set of guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/moddiquette)for moderators of Reddit written by community members.

If you have an issue with a moderator that you believe that r/ModerationMediation cannot handle, [Reddit’s advice also provides links](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205192355-What-do-I-do-if-I-have-an-issue-with-a-moderator-) to take your complaint directly to Reddit Admin. Keep in mind that Admin are generally not interested in anything that goes on in any specific subreddit as their concern is for Reddit as a whole.

#Modmail
::Essentials for Newbies::

Sometimes you may need to privately contact the moderators of a Subreddit.

#“Mods are asleep, post……”
::Jargon and Slang::

KnowYourMeme is [surprisingly vague](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2dte8k/comment/cjt1mcd/) on the origins of this phrase, but anecdotal evidence shows it originated on 4chan, like many memes on Reddit. "Mods Are Asleep, post X" was an expression used to indicate that the website's moderators were currently inactive and unable to enforce the site's rules of conduct. The phrase was often followed by a call to action for other users to post material that is typically not allowed. 4chan being, well, 4chan, [you can imagine the reasons why this was popular there](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1vmz6o/comment/cetxew8/).

Reddit being, well, Reddit, embraced the hilarity of this concept thoroughly and now it’s used as an occasional fun device in many subs, usually with the tacit complicity of the mods, as seen in this [example here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/915adc/mods_are_asleep_post_thermos/) where they were mocking a spelling / autocarrot mistake, or this which was obviously done with the [indulgence of the mods and not as a rule-breaking exercise](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/csfjfe/comment/exeqspu/).

#MSM
::Acronyms and Initials::

“Mainstream Media”. A term used widely in the conspiracy subreddits. This is added here as it’s increasingly crossing over into other subs.

---

#Multipost
::Essentials for Newbies::

There are many subs which overlap in content, and you might wish to post the same thing in all of them, usually when asking for help. This is called a Multipost. This is different than a Crosspost; multiposting is where you share the same identical content across different Subreddits. This is a risky strategy, especially for a new user, as you could easily be mistaken for a Spambot. If you do post the same question in different subreddits, make sure you don’t copy & paste the same wording across to them all, otherwise you might fall foul of Reddit’s spam filters which might even get you a ban.

You should also bear in mind that multiposting might inadvertently work against you. For instance, your cute kitten doing a [“crab puff”](https://youtu.be/ApL93cy5Z70) that you posted in r/crabcats might also be the perfect candidate for posting in r/Kitten, r/SpicyKittens, r/illegallysmolcats and indeed most of [our many cat subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catsubs/wiki/index) but as cat lovers are almost contractually bound to be joined to all those subs, they might not take too kindly to their feed being full of your kitty, no matter how pretty. If you do still want to post those paws in all those subs, space the timing around a bit. You might want to use different titles too.

Some subreddits do not allow Multiposts.  r/conspiracyNOPOL (a place to discuss conspiracies with the primary exception of US domestic politics) have [strict rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/mdztzi/no_more_multiposts_bans_to_be_issued_from_now_on/) and their own precise definition, called:

>WHAT IS A MULTIPOST?  
>  
>Multipost: spamming the same content multiple times across different subs  
>  
>• ⁠Multiposts take little effort to create but push original content down the NOPOL front page  
• ⁠We primarily want quality content from the NOPOL community, not dilution from elsewhere  
• ⁠There is (almost) no circumstance where a multipost will be allowed

This is why I’m always banging on about how important it is to always check the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) before commenting or posting on an unfamiliar Subreddit.

#Neckbeard
::Jargon and Slang::

A derogatory term used to describe those who in past years would have been called geeks, nerds or even dorks; i.e. *The Average Redditor*™. The term comes from the percieved poor hygiene of Redditors, and the connotation is that due to obesity and slovenly habits, the person will have beard stubble on their neck, but never in sufficient amounts to be described as a full beard due to a lack of masculinity (exemplified by said obesity and habits).

Like so much of online slang post-2000, 4chan can be cited as a distribution source, if not the originator of the term. Generally, someone is called a ‘neckbeard’ when they judge other people for their faults but do not see any faults of their own. Sometimes interwebs people are mean spirited.

r/justneckbeardthings, r/neckbeard, r/NeckbeardNests (prepare to suffer) are… well… subreddits, as is r/averageredditor.

#New Reddit; Old Reddit
::Lore and History::

The story so far: in the beginning, Reddit was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. First, there was Old Reddit, but it was only known as Reddit at the time. Then the Reddit Admins redesigned the site and that was known as The Redesign.  [This did not go down at all well](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/9x8l3x/my_thoughts_on_new_reddit_vs_old_reddit/). So, they kept Old Reddit too, for those who preferred it. An uneasy truce prevailed. Until…. along came that young whippersnapper, The App. Which briefly united Old and New users [in their hatred](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/byxyp5/why_do_people_hate_the_reddit_app_so_much/) of the promising young interloper.

Old Reddit is sometimes called 'classic' or 'legacy’ Reddit, and The Redesign has now become known as New Reddit. The App is just known as The App unless you’re an iOS mobile user in which case it is known as *\[EXPLETIVE DELETED\]* because [it’s buggy](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/pfu4s2/today_for_you_on_reddit/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).  r/redditmobile is an essential addition to your home feed as it’s the official community for App users where admin give details of all new updates and users can complain about every last one of them.

If you are a new Redditor using the website (or a web browser on mobile) you're probably already using New Reddit as it's the default for new users. However, you can temporarily view each design by changing the URL in your address bar:

* [https://reddit.com/](https://reddit.com/) takes you to your default
* [https://old.reddit.com/](https://old.reddit.com/) takes you to Old Reddit
* [https://new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com/) takes you to New Reddit

There is an ‘opt out of redesign’ toggle at the bottom of this page [https://www.reddit.com/settings/](https://www.reddit.com/settings/) if you prefer old Reddit.  r/redesign was a subreddit [to discuss and troubleshoot](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/d6icz0/we_are_making_some_changes_and_heres_how_to_keep/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) New Reddit, although it’s now closed to new submissions.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Old vs. New doesn’t just mean versions of Reddit. r/oldvsnew is for comparison pictures of old stuff compared to them when they were new, r/BeforeNAfterAdoption is a place to share the amazing difference a loving family can make on an abandoned or mistreated animal, r/NewAgain is for progress pics If you have taken something old and made it new again, r/OldPhotosInRealLife compare past and present locations through photography and r/ReversePinterest showcases items of furniture that have been recovered from the damage done by “Pinteresting” it.

#New Year Celebrations on Reddit
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

As you would imagine, the New Year is a special time on Reddit, as people are winding down from Christmas and anticipating the New Year ahead.

Every year end, Reddit have a [Reddit Recap](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-recap-2021) to sum up the year gone by, and in 2021 they gave us our own individual summary of our past year’s activity [which looked like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/u8fb84/my_reddit_recap_testing_a_gallery_upload/).

* **Ring out the old, ring in the new!**

Start that New Year with these subreddits:

* r/HappyNewYear
* r/newyear
* r/fireworks
* r/Fireworksgonewrong
* r/FireworksGoneWild

We all try to dedicate ourselves to being a bit better than we were the previous year, and the various self-improvement subreddits are all ready and waiting with helpful ideas and tips on keeping your r/newyearsresolutions.

* r/selfimprovement
* r/decidingtobebetter
* r/howtonotgiveafuck
* r/productivity
* r/selfhelp
* r/declutter

* r/bodybuilding
* r/running

Some of these may even feature in [this interesting article](https://www.online-tech-tips.com/cool-websites/30-best-self-improvement-subreddits-on-reddit/) you might find helpful.

* **Holiday Burnout**

After the excesses of the holiday season, many of us swear “never again” and if you really mean it this time, we have subs to help you there too such as:

* r/loseit
* r/SelfSufficiency
* r/anticonsumption
* r/EatCheapAndHealthy
* r/sugarfree
* r/coldshowers

There are many resources on Reddit dedicated to all kinds of topics, and the ones I list in this article are just a small fraction of what we have available.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Rereddit takes a look back at the [top posts from January 2021](https://www.reddit.com/posts/2021/january/), and it’s interesting to see how many of these ballooned into enduring memes or faded into obscurity. Use the Calendar on the right-hand side to delve into further Reddit history.

#Next-Generation Recommendations

#“Ninja Edit:”
::Jargon and Slang::

A Ninja Edit is commonly an edit to a post or comment made before someone points out the need for an edit. It is often a person correcting themselves when they caught their mistake or needed to add more information. The best ones happen so quick that Reddit doesn't show the "last edited" asterisk, hence “ninja”.

#“No good deed goes unpunished”
::Jargon and Slang::

A phrase used as a sardonic commentary on the frequency with which acts of kindness backfire on those who offer them. Unfortunately, Reddit often likes to be judge, jury and executioner of those who perform good deeds if they are filmed (knowingly or unknowingly) for social media. r/changemyview is a good [place to debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fa5ws9/cmv_doing_good_deeds_selfishly_such_as_filming/) the rights and wrongs of visible Charity.

Videoing acts of kindness will always elicit a slew of [mixed responses](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/mzlf8c/we_need_more_people_like_them/), and the general conclusion is nearly always some variant of “It's actually a lot more messed up that there's some sort of weird taboo against posting about helping strangers or helpless people. Filming it might inspire others to do the same.” And sometimes [people *are* inspired by others](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/qbjuin/helping_an_elderly_man_find_his_car/hhajqby/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3). Ah, Reddit; never change.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Find these lovely things at r/HumansBeingBros, r/MadeMeSmile or r/MadeMeCry, debate said lovely things at r/changemyview and suggest said lovely things should be everyday occurrences at r/unpopularopinion.

Sometimes it isn’t always straightforward where to post that feel-good story. Is [this one](https://www.kixbrooksradio.com/2021/11/18/hero-of-the-week-cash-daniels/) a good fit for the r/UpliftingNews sub or more suited for r/ABoringDystopia?

Also known as the [NAXALT or N.A.X.A.L.T. fallacy](https://i.redd.it/okws5yh4pty81.jpg), this is the mistaken belief that because you can name someone who is an outlier and “Not Like That” it nullifies the fact that the majority is in fact, very much Like That.

A fallacy of division, NAXALT is an informal fallacy that occurs when one reasons that something that is true for a whole must also be true of all or some of its parts. A type of “strawman argument”, this phrase is widely used without taking nuance into account, sometimes quite innocently but more often very deliberately.

Just because there are exceptions to the rule, that doesn’t mean that a statement isn’t true for the most part. For instance, when someone comes into this sub complaining that [“all mods are bad”](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/uh3hna/karma_is_the_stupidest_thing/) I’ll often use some form of [“not all of us”](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/nxjpe1/2nd_sub_ban/) which is technically true but glosses over the fact that the mods on this sub have to be more lenient than those elsewhere because of the nature of this sub.

It’s entirely possible to get lost in a meta-recursive argument trying to prove or disprove the NAXALT fallacy, simply because ”Not all X *are* Like That”, whatever “X” represents. On the surface, the statement is true. Not all of one thing *is* like another, whatever that thing might be. However, in argument, the phrase is never used in an innocuous manner, but rather used as a form of deflection and invalidation. When I’m saying “yeah, but I’m a nice mod, give us a chance” I’m ignoring all the mods who - for whatever reason - aren’t like me.

Because this fallacy is widely used in political subs or others when addressing racial issues, let’s look at the phrase “All Lives Matter”. Yes, of course they do, but it isn’t nearly so innocent as it appears because that’s not what the phrase is about. In the r/explainlikeimfive subreddit in 2015 a Redditor gave an excellent [explanation as to what it actually means](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3du1qm/eli5_why_is_it_so_controversial_when_someone_says/ct8pei1/), which was actually cited by Vox in a superb 2016 article entitled [“Why you should stop saying “all lives matter,” explained in 9 different ways”](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/11/12136140/black-all-lives-matter).

It’s also very much an issue on subreddits that discuss gender and equality. Back in 2014, the question [“What is ‘Not All Men’” ](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2ef5z7/what_is_not_all_men/)from the subreddit r/OutOfTheLoop prompted an interesting discussion, some of it hidden under deleted comments which should be expanded by tapping the [tiny little arrows](https://i.redd.it/ujhwkgo9duy81.jpg) to reveal the rest.

#Notorious Redditors
::Lore and History::

While Reddit is about the content and not the Redditor, some Redditors have achieved notoriety because of their content. Some who are faded from view but still referenced are:

Unidan; a [Redditor who became notorious](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/2c9ida/recap_unibanned_a_recap_of_the_fallout_of_reddits/) for sharing their vast knowledge about birds but, during a heated discussion was found to be [vote manipulating using Alts](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/pk8q2m/the_nfsa_has_released_colourised_footage_of_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and permanently suspended.

SpontaneousH; a [Redditor who became notorious](https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/68srty/spontaneoush_uses_heroin_gets_addicted_dies_gets/) for documenting their use of illegal drugs from the first experiment through a downward spiral to clinical death and eventual rehabilitation.

There are more; there are always more. I may well add more.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/SubredditDrama is a place where people can come and talk about Reddit fights and other dramatic happenings from other Subreddits.

#NP or “No Participation”
::Acronyms and Initials::

You might see the letters (NP) in post titles, especially where they have been crossposted from another subreddit. Meaning “No Participation”, this is to warn people against going to participate in the original thread.

Some subreddits accept crossposts from other subreddits in order to discuss them in a different environment, such as r/AmITheAngel, a satirical sub [for absurd AITA posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAngel/comments/rczp53/the_journey_from_aita_to_amitheangel/). Subs doing this usually impose a "do not comment in linked threads" rule, such as theirs which states “*Satirizing of posts should stay within this sub, which means that participating directly in linked posts should either be done in good faith or not at all.*”

On “Old Reddit” some subs would use certain url prefixes to access areas of Reddit such as the NP (No Participation) domain at [https://np.reddit.com](https://np.reddit.com/) to enforce this rule. You [can read more about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoParticipation/wiki/intro). While not required any more, using the NP domain of reddit when crossposting helps to protect both your account (and the accounts of other users) from bans. The NP domain can be accessed by replacing the "www" in your reddit link with "np".

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

We have some Subreddits that exist for **not** participating in, including:

* r/Amish
* r/GermanHumor
* r/GoodCardiBSongs
* r/thingsjonsnowknows

Ah, Reddit; never change.

#NSFL
::Acronyms and Initials::

“Not Safe For Life”. Denotes dangerous practices ahead. Not easy viewing. One huge step above NSFW, this type of post is usually very disturbing, extreme, highly offensive or contains gore. Click a link marked NSFL with extreme caution, or, preferably, don’t click it at all. Needs to be used more on Reddit to distinguish such content from NSFW.

**See Also:**

* [NSFW](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_nsfw)

---

#NSFW
::Acronyms and Initials::

“Not Safe For Work”. You must be 18+ to view this adult-oriented content. It basically means if you’re at work or in company, you probably shouldn’t open it. You cannot enter a sub (or profile) marked NSFW without going through a warning screen first. SFW is the opposite, meaning that despite appearances the content of the link is “Safe For Work”. NSFW usually denotes profanity or nudity ahead, but not always. Be warned that sometimes people will link things more suited for an NSFL warning, so you’ll need to use your judgment carefully before clicking through.

Your profile will be marked as NSFW should you interact with an NSFW sub. NSFW subreddits and profiles are not allowed to use Reddit's native image and video uploader, and must host videos elsewhere and make link posts. However, the app currently allows users to bypass the NSFW restriction and allows them to post direct images.  [Admins are aware of this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/s5v43z/upload_images_in_my_community/). NSFW videos do not have sound, as it is disabled automatically.

If a picture is uploaded and the post is marked NSFW, it will automatically have the [blur feature applied](https://i.redd.it/1lzq9pk3z0z81.jpg) regardless of the [actual content](https://i.redd.it/w1xejl3li0z81.jpg).

At [https://www.reddit.com/settings/feed](https://www.reddit.com/settings/feed) you can choose to see NSFW content or not, and if you choose to see it, you can also choose to blur it with safe browsing mode. In the browser it is called "Safe Browsing Mode" and is on the Feed Settings page. On mobile, tap your avatar top left, [settings at the bottom](https://i.redd.it/ox0xqepzzvt81.jpg), then you can toggle NSFW content on or off and toggle the blur too. You can check your feed settings here for NSFW stuff [https://www.reddit.com/settings/feed](https://www.reddit.com/settings/feed)though it's not always marked, especially if you’re on iOS.

On the iOS app, NSFW settings can be found in your **device settings** page after selecting the Reddit app, and NOT the Reddit app itself. You'll want to enable "Show NSFW Content (18+)" and disable "Blur NSFW Images".

Alternatively, the settings on Old Reddit here [https://old.reddit.com/prefs/](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/) allow you to select not to have image previews/thumbnails show and you can turn autoplay off for videos. Turn on the option “I am over eighteen years old and willing to view adult content”, scroll down to the bottom, and click the \[save options\] button. Turn on the option “include not safe for work (NSFW) search results in searches”, scroll down to the bottom, and click the \[save options\] button.

#NSFW Accounts
::Acronyms and Initials::

Sometimes you might see a profile with an [exclamation mark (!) with a red outline](https://i.redd.it/w1xejl3li0z81.jpg) displayed next to the username.

Only appearing on some platforms, it means the profile is marked as NSFW / adult content. NSFW on Reddit doesn’t always mean “adult content” in the same way as one might imagine. Profiles marked like this might have posted or commented on a subreddit marked NSFW for containing routine profanity, or some MMA subs, or even some meme subs which are marked this way in fun.

It's there just to warn others in case they don't want to see adult content, and there’s no harm or “flag” to the account in it being there. An NSFW account can be changed in settings at: [https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile](https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile) but participating in any NSFW subreddits will mean it’ll probably come back.

Please note that NSFW profiles automatically don't allow uploading of video / gifs to Reddit’s servers because Reddit auto disables it.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Meme subs that are marked NSFW in fun include r/avocadosgonewild for big, gaping holes… in avocados and r/trolliesgonewild for abandoned shopping trollies found in the wild, exposing themselves in public. These subs prefer salacious titles only to their innocent photos. r/chairsunderwater is for pictures of chairs, underwater. So why does the sub have an NSFW tag? Because in here, NSFW stands for 'Not Submerged Fully in Water'.

r/manholeporn is a sub for SFW pictures of sewer covers in all their cast iron glory and absolutely no NSFW pictures of man holes. There are many subreddits that are labelled as “porn” but aren’t, such as r/RoadPorn, r/InfrastructurePorn, and r/retailporn. A partial list of these can be [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sfwpornnetwork/wiki/network#wiki_nature) and a Multireddit of [some of them here](https://www.reddit.com/user/kjoneslol/m/sfwpornnetwork). Finally, r/NoLongerNSFW lists subs that are no longer porn or abandoned and converted to something else - mostly cats!

#NYTO or “No, you’re thinking of...”
::Acronyms and Initials::

Linking the time-honoured Reddit Traditions of going wildly off topic with Comment Chains and derailing a comment with Puns while adding a *soupçon* of “The Ole Reddit Switch-a-roo", NYTO is an opportunity rarely missed for Redditors try to outdo each other with endless puns as usual.

NYTO is where people will respond to a question with information about a word that sounds similar to the one in the original question. The next person in the chain responds with "no, you're thinking of" and then responds the same way while setting the next user up with an opportunity to respond in turn.  [This is an ideal example](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hclu6/whats_your_favorite_thing_you_own_that_you_never/c1uckbr/?context=2) of a semi-serious query which soon devolves into absolute nonsense.

[Another perfect NYTO occurred here](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/mrz3fa/in_1945_a_group_of_soviet_school_children/gupikhy/) after a fascinating and true historical discovery, and [this one turned a mildly infuriating incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/s2nxpk/came_home_after_a_long_shift_went_to_get_some/hsgd35w/) into a highly underrated exchange.

#ObviousPlant
::Jargon and Slang::

A link or phrase posted when people fall for a satirical product made by the prankster [ObviousPlant](https://obviousplant.com/) and Redditor u/obviousplant by mistaking it for a genuine product. This Subreddit documents the times people fell for [one of his pranks or fake toys](https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-fake-products-obvious-plant/) thinking it might be a bootleg “knock-off”.  r/ObviousPlant.

Real “off brands” of varying quality can be [found on Reddit](https://www.redpoints.com/blog/reddit-fashion-replicas/) and *caveat emptor* (“Buyer Beware” i.e. the buyer purchases at their own risk) on any of those subreddits as we also have an unhealthy amount of [scams](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/7/#wiki_scams) on Reddit. That cute [T-Shirt posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/8/#wiki_t-shirt_posts) you see on a random sub won’t be what it looks like either.

r/onejob is the repository for the classic "You Had One Job!" moments, while r/ididthejobboss is for those "Task failed successfully" moments of doing something perfectly in an unexpected manner or even something stupid which technically completes the task.

For intentional bad design, try r/HostileArchitecture where public spaces are constructed or altered to discourage people from using them in a way not intended by the owner, r/crazystairs(and escalators too) and the wonderfully bizarre r/PurpleCoco for some extremely odd places to find power outlets.

#OC
::Acronyms and Initials::

“Original Content”. We are all feeding from each other, all the time, every day. But you should only use this tag for stuff you absolutely made yourself. Don’t ever post other people’s stuff and call it OC; Redditors are keener than bloodhounds and will sniff it out within minutes. Downvotes and maybe even worse will surely follow, and you don’t want to appear on r/quityourbullshit.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

As the initialism “OC” has different associations, I would be remiss in not mentioning r/TheOCfor the "official" subreddit of the American teen drama television series “The O.C.”. Or indeed r/OrangeCounty \- the subreddit for Orange County, California.

#Occam's Razor
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Occam's Razor is a saying commonly known as an “Eponymous Law”, but more accurately as a [Philosophical Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor) that reads [”Entities should not be multiplied without necessity.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor).

In philosophy, a razor is a principle or a rule of thumb that allows for the elimination (the “shaving off”) of unlikely explanations for a phenomenon.

Applied broadly, this particular principle suggests that out of two competing theories, the simpler explanation is more likely to be correct. Also called “the law of economy” or “the law of parsimony”, Occam's Razor gives precedence to simplicity to avoid unnecessary or improbable assumptions. This principle is attributed to the 14th century logician and Franciscan friar William of Ockham, but the general idea goes back at least as far as Aristotle, who wrote *"Nature operates in the shortest way possible."*

It is important to note that, like any mental model, Occam’s Razor is not foolproof. There are exceptions to any rule, and we should never blindly follow the results of applying a mental model which logic, experience, or empirical evidence contradict. When you hear hoofbeats behind you, in most cases you should think horses, not zebras - unless you are out on the African savannah.  [Or alpacas if you’re in Birmingham (U.K.)](https://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2022/06/10/alpaca-runs-loose-Soho-Road-Birmingham/1591654875799/).

The opposite of Occam’s Razor is “Occam’s Duct Tape”, which is when someone approaches a problem with a ridiculously large number of assumptions. Also known as Occam's Krazy Glue or Occam's Stapler, this is only used ironically as it involves making as many unnecessary and irrelevant assumptions as possible.

* **Anti-Razors**

While a philosophical razor can be a useful mental shortcut that allows you to make decisions and solve problems quickly and easily, it is not an unbreakable law or rule, and several “anti-razors” have been devised over the years to counter them.

For instance, Walter Chatton (c.  1290–1343) was a contemporary of William of Ockham who took exception to Occam's Razor and Ockham's use of it. In response he devised his own Anti-razor: *"If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added, and so on."*

A paraphrase of Occam's Razor (the simplest diagnosis is the most likely to be correct) forms one of the [three maxims of medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34355545/), with the other two being anti-razors: Hickam's Dictum (multiple disease entities are more likely than one), and Crabtree's Bludgeon (the tendency to make data fit to an explanation we hold dear).

**Crabtree's Bludgeon** addresses confirmation bias - our natural instinct to interpret information in a way that affirms our prior hypotheses - and was expressed as: *"No set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation, however complicated."* Joseph Crabtree, in contrast to William of Ockham, was not a theologian. In fact, he never even existed as he is a fictional character created in 1954 by Sir James Sutherland at University College, London as an academic satire.

**Hickam’s Dictum** is a counterargument to the use of Occam's razor, emerging from the medical profession. The actual provenance of this appears to be apocryphal, with some claiming the name is completely random or perhaps chosen just to rhyme with Occam, though some attribute it to [John Bamber Hickam](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/577801) (1914 – 1970); a faculty member at Duke University in the 1950s.

Whichever explanation is correct, Hickam’s Dictum was a response to when one single unifying diagnosis is not possible. While Occam's Razor suggests that the simplest explanation is the most likely, implying in medicine that diagnosticians should assume a single cause for multiple symptoms, one form of Hickam’s Dictum states: *"A man can have as many diseases as he damn well pleases.”* So, for instance, while a headache diagnosed with Occam’s Razor is just, in fact, a headache (which for the vast majority of cases is true), Hickam’s Dictum allows for the possibility for it to also be a symptom of something less benign (which in significantly fewer cases is also true).

* **Occam's Razor on Reddit**

Reddit, as you would expect, takes Occam's Razor [Very Seriously Indeed™](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/nad12f/how_does_one_use_ockhams_razor_properly/), and is a [common subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2ua12u/eli5_why_is_occams_razor_a_thing/) often raised at ELI5 [or CMV](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1f71uu/i_believe_occam_s_razor_to_be_an_extremely_naive/).

#Official Reddit Announcements
::Features of Reddit::

Every so often, Reddit needs to make general announcements meant to reach all users. These are usually about changes to the Reddit interface, updates, bug fixes, changes to the Content Policy, starting / discontinuing Reddit processes, events, campaigns or any other sitewide issues. Sometimes these appear in a banner notice at the top of your page when you first open Reddit, but not always, and the best place to keep in touch with what’s happening here is:

* r/reddit \- this is the essential sub for sitewide notices, and I strongly recommend you subscribe there to be sure you don’t miss anything you might want - or need - to know.

Relaunched in 2022, it replaced several different subs which are all now closed to new submissions but remain there as useful archives:

* r/announcements \- Official announcements from team Reddit.
* r/blog \- Official blog subreddit, with links to Reddit’s presence on other social media.
* r/changelog \- Official information from Reddit, Inc. on minor updates and bug fixes applied to Reddit.

Other subreddits for official Reddit announcements that are still kept up-to-date are:

* r/redditmobile \- An official community for announcements from Reddit, Inc. and discussion about official Reddit apps for mobile phones and tablets.
* r/redditsecurity \- A running log of actions taken to improve the security of Reddit.
* r/modnews \- An official community for announcements from Reddit, Inc. pertaining to moderation.

Subscribing to them won’t clog up your feed as they aren’t the busiest of places, but will help ensure you don’t miss anything you might need to know about changes to Reddit.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/shittychangelog is like r/changelog, but, y'know.

#One-word Replies
::Essentials for Newbies::

One-word replies are often seen as low-quality and often frowned upon in Reddit. So don’t post them. Except when you should. You have to know the rules to know when you can break them and some notable exceptions are Cat. or cat., (when you see a cat in a picture), Nice., (when you see the number 69), This\^ or This., (when you want to agree with a point). Ah, Reddit; never change.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/onewordeach is a subreddit for group improv one word at a time, while r/AskOuija answers your burning questions one letter at a time. Looking quite elaborate in comparison, r/threewordstories is a growing community of storytellers who collaborate to tell epic tales. The tricky part…. You can only submit 3 words at a time.

#Online Manipulation
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Online Manipulation can be defined to be the use of human psychological weaknesses to redirect behaviour on wide-ranging hidden agendas ranging from something as simple as buying a non-existent t-shirt or print on a subreddit to voting in a real-world political election. [Studies](https://nissenbaum.tech.cornell.edu/papers/Online%20manipulation%20Hidden%20Influences%20In%20a%20Digital%20World.pdf) on the various [abilities and techniques](https://cxl.com/blog/online-manipulation-all-the-ways-youre-currently-being-deceived/) of all kinds of bad actors to [manipulate us](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1320040111) in ways that are not in our best interests are simultaneously fascinating and chilling.

Manipulation isn’t new. In 2019, Forbes ran a fascinating [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereklidow/2019/08/11/we-must-curtail-online-manipulation-before-its-too-late-here-are-four-things-we-can-do/) on Edward Bernays, the [“father of public relations,”](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/08/16/specials/bernays-obit.html) whose pioneering techniques for influencing public opinion and behavior date all the way back to the first decade of the 20th century.

Knowing we’re being manipulated isn’t new either. Vance Packard’s *”The Hidden Persuaders”* was first published in 1957 and was one of the first popular books to describe the psychological techniques advertisers and marketers use to sell us their wares. Incidentally, his book *”The Waste Makers”* was one of the first to draw our attention to planned obsolescence too.

Things that seem obvious to us today are only so because people like this over the years opened our eyes to what goes on behind the scenes. To quote from the Forbes article: *Bernays created a campaign called “Reach for a Lucky Instead of a Sweet,” fostering the impression that smoking aided weight loss. The campaign featured images of slender women smoking cigarettes. Much to the detriment of public health for a century to come, women bought into it.*. They bought into it because then, that was a new way of thinking, little realising it was nothing else but a sales technique.

Nowadays, we all know that billboard-style advertising isn’t nearly so innocent as it appears to be, but they didn’t know that then so the technique worked. What we need to be aware of these days is that strategies used in the promotion of consumerism are still used to sway thought patterns in general, and, like then, they aren’t obvious. Marketers are still employing the findings of psychology in order to market more aggressively to consumers, but in a lot more sophisticated ways and for far more things than just selling cigarettes. Our entry on [Astroturfing](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/2/#wiki_astroturfing) looks at who might be doing this and why.

In “normal” Redditing, Reddit’s favourite techniques for manipulation come mostly in the form of diversionary tactics using logical fallacies and confirmation biases, like this example of [“Reddit Bingo” shows](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/ttww5d/moon_knight_gets_review_bombed_for_alleged/i3281oo/), and below you’ll find some links on the more common ones.

#Online status controls
::Essentials for Newbies::

A recent (2021) addition to your Reddit Profile is your Online Status. This is optional. If you don’t want to share your online status, you can disable the feature by tapping the Online Status button below your Snoovatar, or the ‘privacy options’ section of your preferences, uncheck ‘Let others see my online status’ then click ‘save options’.

When you turn off Online Status, people won’t see any status for you at all - not even an indicator saying that you’re offline or that you’ve selected ‘Off’. Accounts that you’ve blocked will never see your online status. Additionally, if an account is banned from a community, they won't be able to see the online status of anyone in that community.  [Here’s what the updated status and controls look like](https://preview.redd.it/jf9ncycvzfn61.png).

#Orangered
::Features of Reddit::

Orangered refers to the colour (orange/red) of the envelope that glowed when you had a new Direct Message (before it was replaced with the bell icon) and the default Upvote arrow. r/dataisbeautiful gives a good explanation [with an infographic](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ayttxc/the_true_color_of_the_reddit_upvote_button_oc/).

Orangered (FF4500, PMS 172 C), is actually Reddit’s primary brand color, [chosen for its vibrancy & distinctiveness.](https://www.redditinc.com/brand) It has provoked [arguments](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rdankmemes-upvote-arrow-color-debate), and sparked a [conflict](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2jne44/what_was_the_great_orangeredperiwinkle_clash_of/) which led to having its own [trophy](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrophyWiki/comments/f0prgq/reddit_trophy_team_orangered/) as did [its opponent](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrophyWiki/comments/f0prvr/reddit_trophy_team_periwinkle/).

#Other Useful Dictionaries, Encyclopaedias and Lexicons
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

As I say in the preface: “This is a list of some common acronyms, initialisms, terms, memes, references and responses often used on the internet with an emphasis on those specifically used on Reddit. ...in no way intended to be definitive...”. There are far more Internet terms and memes and pop-culture references and cognitive biases and new definitions and logical fallacies than I could possibly cover here, and some valuable resources include:

* [All The Tropes](https://allthetropes.fandom.com/wiki/All_The_Tropes_Wiki) A wiki dedicated to the people, projects and patterns of creative writing in all kinds of entertainment: television, literature, movies, video games, and more.
* [Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/) A website dedicated to documenting Internet phenomena: viral videos, image macros, memes, catchphrases, and more. NSFW.
* [T.V. Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/) An all-devouring pop-culture wiki, which catalogues and cross-references recurrent plot devices, archetypes, and tropes in all forms of media.
* [Slangit](https://slangit.com/) A searchable dictionary of slang terms, acronyms, abbreviations, and emoticons.
* [Acronym Finder](https://www.acronymfinder.com/) With more than 1,000,000 human-edited definitions, Acronym Finder is the world's largest and most comprehensive dictionary of acronyms, abbreviations, and initialisms.
* [The Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/) For those word definitions that the Oxford English Dictionary just hasn’t gotten round to yet. NSFW.
* [Encyclopædia Dramatica](https://dramatica.online/index.php?title=Main_Page). NSFW.
* [Rational Wiki](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page) Analyzing and refuting “pseudoscience”, their daily definition is always worth reading.
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About) As a regular donator and occasional editor *(insert smug face emoticon here)*, I would be remiss in not mentioning this incredible resource in this list.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/wikipedia collects some of the most interesting pages on Wikipedia, r/coolguides have picture based reference guides for anything and everything and r/tvtropes discuss both T.V. tropes and the website.  r/4chan (NSFW) also exists. The bot u/WikipediaSummary is an opt-in service bot created by u/Gullyn1 that replies to comments with a summary of Wikipedia articles.

#OTP
::Acronyms and Initials::

An acronym with several meanings (One-time Password or On The Phone in txt-spk), on Reddit this stands for “One True Pairing”. A crossover from Tumblr, you’ll often see this on fandom based subreddits where it signifies a person’s favourite [fictional romantic relationship](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/what-does-otp-mean-one-true-pairing), or “ship”.

Once a “ship” is established, it’s then usually written as: Character/Character, CharacterxCharacter or even as CharActer - a blend of the characters’ names to create a new [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) word.

#Oversharing
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Oversharing is when people share too much personal information to someone they’re talking to whether a family member or friend, a stranger, or online. However, it can be a big problem on many social media sites, which make "putting yourself online" easy, especially with the rise of the genre of social media that requires you to document your lifestyle in every little detail. Oversharing is quite subjective and it can be confusing as to what content constitutes oversharing as everyone's comfort level and perspectives are different. Even the social media platform used varies widely on what’s counted as oversharing; whereas something like NextDoor generally frowns upon using nicknames and likes you to “sign” your contributions, Reddit generally frowns upon the use of real names, and any attempt to “sign” your posts or comments will be met with derision.

* **Why do we overshare?**

[An infographic](https://i.redd.it/ztqwjq252fz81.png) produced in 2012 for [Online-education](https://www.online-education.net/) concludes that oversharing comes from three main emotional causes:  *It’s Satisfying*; *We’re Upset* and *We’re Excited*. While the infographic is a good introduction and even cites research sources, it only really scratches the surface of this issue. Certainly there are far more - and deeper - psychological reasons at play, and as you would expect, oversharing is frequently discussed at the support subreddits r/ADHD, r/selfimprovement, r/socialskills, r/Anxiety, and r/socialanxiety (among others) for example:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/dzclrt/how\_do\_i\_stop\_oversharing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/dzclrt/how_do_i_stop_oversharing/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/t39wdx/how\_do\_i\_stop\_oversharing\_with\_people/](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/t39wdx/how_do_i_stop_oversharing_with_people/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/f8584j/how\_do\_i\_keep\_from\_oversharing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/f8584j/how_do_i_keep_from_oversharing/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/o65y8h/omg\_do\_you\_cringe\_at\_yourself\_for\_oversharing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/o65y8h/omg_do_you_cringe_at_yourself_for_oversharing_in/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1qoxl7/anyone\_hear\_overshare\_about\_their\_lives/](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1qoxl7/anyone_hear_overshare_about_their_lives/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/q3x7iw/why\_do\_i\_overshare\_so\_much\_when\_talking\_to\_people/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/q3x7iw/why_do_i_overshare_so_much_when_talking_to_people/)

All the above posts give varying levels of advice and coping strategies which are worth reading if you feel that oversharing might be an issue for you or someone you know.

* **But why** ***do*** **we overshare?**

Simply put, the real reason we overshare online is [because the platforms want us to](https://www.makeuseof.com/stop-oversharing-social-media/). Information and details about individuals can be incredibly valuable, and they - we - have become [a valuable commodity](https://medium.com/redmorph/your-data-is-a-commodity-why-the-line-between-privacy-and-security-is-blurry-bb3427d2df9f).

Social media outlets give us that [satisfying dopamine hit](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/dopamine-the-pathway-to-pleasure), and we give them our [every private detail in return](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0306422020917608). They are playing on our instinctive needs to make us feel we have to share everything because everyone else does, just to keep us online. In return, they are harvesting our personal information and driving us to overconsumption while simultaneously causing us social anxiety because our lives aren’t “like that” but we’re told they can or should be. And the longer we stay online there, the more [advertising revenue](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-advertising/social-media-advertising/worldwide) we generate for them too.

* **Sharing isn’t always caring**

In a normal conversation, if one person shares a life detail (“I’m doing X tomorrow”) it’s natural to reciprocate (“You lucky thing, I always wanted to do X”). Because online life isn’t as provable as that, it’s impossible to tell how much of the lives of others is authentic, and we can easily get sucked into exaggeration as everyone tries to outdo each other. As I say in the entry [FOMO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/4/#wiki_fomo):

>Instagram *et al* creates distorted perceptions of the carefully edited lives of others. The constant “upward social comparisons” and unreasonable expectations we are constantly bombarded with can adversely impact our self-esteem. We can easily feel lonely and inadequate through the relentless highlighting of the [“perfect lives” of others](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lfiaxz/irl_friends_of_social_media_influencers_what_is/) in comparison with our own daily routine-led existence.  
>  
>It helps to remind ourselves that in the end people are desperately trying to show themselves in the best possible light on social networks, and Subreddits like r/Instagramreality highlight the [subtle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagramreality/comments/q8cg2g/the_blur_on_that_thigh_i_love_her_but_lol/) and the [not-so-subtle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagramreality/comments/q9i9v2/the_fact_that_she_gives_dieting_advice_and_is/) use of tools like Facetune and Photoshop in portraying unreality as reality.

Seeing shouldn’t always be believing, on social media at least.

* **So, now what?**

Reddit can be a great place to work on your social skills because you alone decide the level and tone of your interactions; you can “walk away” from any conversation for any reason at any time, and most importantly, because nobody knows you, nothing that is said here is really *that*personal. Don’t forget, on Reddit, nobody really pays attention to - or even remembers - usernames.

As well as the subreddits already mentioned, we have many places to explore personal growth such as r/selfhelp, r/declutter, r/habits, r/decidingtobebetter, r/howtonotgiveafuck, r/getdisciplined and r/nosurf: a community of people who are focused on becoming more productive and wasting less time mindlessly surfing the internet.

Online people have a strange identity; some have likened it to be almost as if [everyone else is an NPC](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/8g7ynd/how_do_i_stop_seeing_other_people_as_npcs/) in the video game of your life. We know they’re real people, but at the same time they’re no more real than the [Social Bunny](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Social_Bunny) or the [Tragic Clown](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Tragic_Clown) are in “The Sims”. Sometimes that’s even true, as in 2020, it was discovered a GPT-3 bot had [been posting in one subreddit for a whole week](https://www.unilad.co.uk/technology/an-ai-was-posting-on-reddit-for-a-whole-week-and-things-got-dark/) without being noticed.

Remember that social media isn’t your life - or anyone else’s. Social media is a useful tool. However, be careful not to let it take over your life. Don't feel like you need to "prove" yourself on social media. In real life, most people don't really care about others' personal lives as much as the internet would have you believe, and when these lives aren’t “real” in the first place, even less.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/Overshare chronicles those times when people give out Too Much Information, way more than we needed to know, pls stahp, while r/insanepeoplefacebook, r/Instagramreality, r/insanepeopletwitter, and r/TikTokCringe are all places to call out exaggerated claims seen on their respective platforms, and r/quityourbullshit calls out anything ridiculous from anywhere.

#Padlock
::Essentials for Newbies::

Sometimes you will see a little yellow padlock icon on a post. That means the post has been locked by the moderators and people can't comment on it any more. Some mods will pin a comment to the top of the post about why it was locked, but it isn’t required and some don’t. Subreddits use the padlock in different ways:

* Some subs lock the post when it has been answered (e.g., r/AskCulinary) and / or the mods deem it unnecessary for the conversation to continue but still want the post visible for people to see and read the info there.
* On some it means they have found a lot of rule violations and / or people are going so wildly off topic they will lock the thread to keep people civil and avoid drama.
* Some subs may lock things that are controversial if there is already a very similar discussion still happening.
* On some subs, it’s because the post has reached the front page and want to avoid a huge influx of non-regulars, trolls or other issues.
* Some subs have a maximum engagement they allow on any one post. This is usually fairly high, but not enough to become unmanageable.
* On r/NewToReddit we lock posts after 7 days because newbies won’t know that if they comment on an older post they won’t get an answer back, but we still want the posts visible for people to see and read the info there.

Moderators can unlock a padlocked post or comment at any time to open it up for new discussion. If your post on a sub gets locked, you could try modmailing the mods, but there is no guarantee that they will answer or that they will tell you why it was locked. Reddit also automatically locks all posts over 6 months old, and these will show a yellow box icon. Again, this is now an option that mods can turn on or off should they need to.

[Padlockmageddon!](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/pfg8nm/what_does_that_weird_yellow_lock_icon_next_to_a/) was a “fun” time on Reddit mid 2021 where every OP had their own comments locked on their posts, and you can read not much more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/pfroqg/new_locked_comments/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/Locksmith is the place where Locksmiths of Reddit hang out and talk shop, while r/lockpickingis a subreddit dedicated to the sport of lockpicking.  r/locksport have a passion for locks and like to share it with other locksport enthusiasts, and r/LockPickingLawyer is for everything related to the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel.

#Parent / Child Comment

#Passwords
::Essentials for Newbies::

Can I still reset my password?* Unfortunately, no. There is currently no way to reset your password unless you have an e-mail address registered. Nobody else can assist you either, the admins will not reset your password for you. If you have forgotten it and you haven't registered an email address, there is nothing you can do. If you're still able to log in to Reddit via saved login details on an existing device, that means the device's browser "remembers" your password. Try looking in your browser's settings to extract the saved password.
* [From the Automod response on r/help:](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/m0pc2i/question_about_reddit_accounts/gq92yiw/) Your question seems to be about having problems logging in with your password.

Your account might have been hijacked](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/49x3ik/is_your_reddit_password_invalid_has_your_verified/). If you are being told that the password on a brand-new account is invalid, you need to contact the Reddit admins.

#Paywalls
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Linking to news articles to back up your point is commendable, but not when they’re [behind a paywall](https://stackdiary.com/how-to-bypass-paywalls/), a regional block or [other block](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/d7nn51/lpt_quora_blocking_you_from_reading_an_answer/). Try not to link to a paywalled article on Reddit; it really won’t end well. Nevertheless, you’re bound to find one sometime in your Redditing, so here are some ways of potentially dealing with them.

Please bear in mind here that all my Redditing is done on an iPad Pro, either via the official app or using a Safari web browser, so your experience might be slightly different.  *Not all of these may work; I haven’t tried all of them.*

* **Google Cache**

Sometimes on Google results, you’ll see a [three dots “kebab” post-overflow menu](https://i.redd.it/7zo2qmmewsz81.jpg). Tapping this will bring up a pop-up menu where you can see three options. Selecting the final “cache” option will open a page [that looks like this](https://i.redd.it/03riot4uysz81.jpg) where if the page still won’t load, selecting the “Text-Only Version” option at the top of the page usually works.

* **Reddit to the rescue?**

r/LifeProTips and r/lifehacks are essential subreddits for all those little things that make a big difference in our lives, and [this is a subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/997cjp/lpt_to_continue_reading_a_news_article_before_the/) that comes up often on [both subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/pvu8e9/get_around_paywalls/). r/YouShouldKnow also tackles [this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/k5x444/ysk_that_its_easy_to_bypass_paywalls_on_news/) from time to time.

* **Methods without installing anything**

Using the Reader View in your browser to block the paywall popup is one method and one Redditor provided links [to instructions for Firefox, Chrome and Safari](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/djpvj4/lpt_used_all_of_your_free_articles_on_a/) here.

Websites recommended to me are:

* [https://12ft.io/](https://12ft.io/)
* [https://archive.org](https://archive.org/) Sometimes works by copy/pasting the URL
* [https://www.printfriendly.com](https://www.printfriendly.com/) Turns a web page into a print-friendly PDF

The first is the most reliable in my experience, but it relies on Google Cache so if the article hasn’t been indexed by Google, it might not work. There have been others in the past but were either often down or grew lists of URLs that they didn’t support which defeated their purpose.

Two tips I’ve been given are:

* If you want to continue reading a news article without signing up, just add a dot(.) after the “.com”
* Add "?share=1" to the end of a Quora link to remove the blur and the sign up pop up.

However, I’ve not tried the first and I don’t use Quora so again, YMMV.

* **Methods requiring installing stuff**

There are plenty of browser extensions for bypassing paywalls for the main web clients; Google (or your favourite alternative) and YouTube will be your friends here. Neither I, this subreddit nor Reddit itself endorse any particular methods on this matter.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/lifehacks and r/LifeProTips aim to improve your life in one way or another; r/shittylifehacksand r/ShittyLifeProTips certainly don’t, and r/unethicallifehacks and r/UnethicalLifeProTipsmight land you in real trouble.

#Pedant; Pedantry
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedant) says “A pedant is a person who is excessively concerned with ...precision, or one who makes an ostentatious and arrogant show of learning.” In other words, [*The Average Redditor*™](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/pedantic). Since the onset of the Internet, it seems that every user somewhere is trying to either outdo, derail or discredit other users by employing some form of pedantry as their weapon of choice, often in grammar or usage due to their errors being relatively easy to spot.

Because the likelihood of making an error in a post is directly proportional to the embarrassment it will cause the poster, it is often the case that the user making the correction will actually get something within their own pedantry wrong; so much so that the phenomenon has inspired three [Internet Adages](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Eponymous_laws):

* [Skitt's Law](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Skitts%20Law): *Any post correcting an error in another post will contain at least one error itself.*
* [Muphry’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muphry%27s_law), (a deliberate misspelling of "Murphy's Law"): *If you write anything criticizing editing or proofreading, there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written.*
* [McKean's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_McKean): *Any correction of the speech or writing of others will contain at least one grammatical, spelling, or typographical error.*

There are more [variations on this theme](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/breaking-muphrys-law/). There will be even more.

* **Pedantry on Reddit.**

It has been said that Reddit has the most unprecedentedly dense concentration of pedantry that has [ever existed in the history of humanity](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/c9kq2f/reddit_has_the_most_unprecedentedly_dense/) and if those comments don’t prove it, nothing will.

Having said that, r/bestof is a sub that catalogues the very best comments on Reddit as submitted by the users of Reddit, and a debate about whether [Reddit’s pedantry](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/8v3hlt/umritopmd_loses_patience_with_reddit_pedantry/) is worse than anywhere else on the internet concludes that it really isn’t. Ah, Reddit; never change…

* **Ackchyually…**

And because Reddit *will* never change, we have [memes about pedants](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/ltsgbq/ackshually/)! The most well known one is the “Reaction” meme [Ackchyually / Actually Guy](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ackchyually-actually-guy).

*Ackchyually* refers to the deliberate misspelling of the word “actually” to reflect the sarcastic slurring of the word to emphasise the importance of the forthcoming pronouncement that is intended to correct or to discredit a statement made on (often but not limited to) a topic dear to them; usually paired with an [illustration of a stereotypical nerdy or geeky person](https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/uy9tq0/why_does_the_fat_sweaty_foureyed_sarcastic/).

* **"You are technically correct, the best type of correct."**

For our second example, here’s an innocuous phrase that is not quite how it appears. This is another of Reddit’s beloved pop-culture references, this time originating from [Futurama S02E14](https://youtu.be/hou0lU8WMgo). And here’s a [typical Reddit example](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/36m7dh/just_a_turtle_eating_pancakes/crfacnb/?context=3) of it in action!

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Pedantry is found all over Reddit; share your instances at r/GrammarNazi, r/pedant, r/pedanticor r/Pedantry, while r/ackchyually is the one place for all your favourite ackchyually meme needs, and r/futurama welcomes you to the wooorld of tomorrowww.

#Perchance
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

An innocuous word that is not quite how it appears, as it is another of Reddit’s beloved pop-culture references: [You can’t just say “perchance”](https://i.redd.it/b972gi1fkoi81.jpg). This originates from a joke tweet about comments on an essay written by the New York comedian [Phil Jamesson](https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Phil_Jamesson) and its use will either prompt a comment chain from those “in the know” or a spirited discussion between those who “know it’s real” [because they’ve had a similar grading experience at school](https://www.reddit.com/r/humour/comments/sx8ass/perchance/) and those who can “prove it’s fake” [because of the date](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/svtltz/the_lifekind_perchance/). Neither group appear to be aware of its true provenance - and both seem to ignore those who point it out.

Even the folks at r/badphilosophy felt the need [to discuss the merits](https://www.reddit.com/r/badphilosophy/comments/swlqjh/what_a_good_essay_looks_like/) (or otherwise) of the essay, and of course it ended up at r/PhilosophyMemes but even then it isn’t clear [what they really thought](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyMemes/comments/svszn6/i_spent_my_soul_on_this_essay_just_for_the/). It is, however, [very clear](https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/swfi35/fine/) what the users at r/Professors thought, even after they knew the origin. Ah, Reddit; never change.

So, just why is *“Mario, the Idea vs. Mario, the Man”* a “bad” essay? After all, the premise is intriguing and shows creativity. The best writing carries some of the personality and individuality of its author, and both are very much on show here. William Strunk and E.B. White, in [*The Elements of Style*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style), list five qualities of good writing (focus, development, unity, coherence, and correctness) as being especially important for academic and expository writing, and these will be the criteria I’ll use in judgment.

* **Focus**

*An essay should have a single clear central idea. Each paragraph should have a clear main point or topic sentence.*

* **Development**

*Each paragraph should support or expand the central idea of the paper. The idea of each paragraph should be explained and illustrated through examples, details, and descriptions.*

* **Unity**

*Every paragraph in an essay should be related to the main idea. Each paragraph should stick to its main point.*

* **Coherence**

*An essay or paper should be organised logically, flow smoothly, and "stick" together. In other words, everything in the writing should make sense to the reader.*

* **Correctness**

*A paper should be written in generally correct standard English, with complete sentences, and be relatively error-free.*

It should be fairly obvious that the essay, as presented, fails to fulfil most of those criteria.

Let’s just take the first sentence for analysis. “Everyone knows Mario is cool as fuck.” If expository writing is meant to explain, inform, clarify, instruct, or define, then the author has already failed in the central idea. The opening of any essay should denote a clear navigational path through the rest of the work. Instead, here, the author has led us into muddy waters from the outset.

“Everyone knows Mario…” is far too broad an assumption to make on the audience. As Mario is the main subject and focus of the essay, we should have had some introduction as to who (or what) “Mario” is; perhaps some form of potted biography or at the very least, a short précis of the world Mario inhabits. As it is, this simple assumption has divided the audience - and possibly lost many of them in the process - with just three words.

The following statement “…is cool as fuck” is worse. It’s far too subjective to use in an academic manner as the author doesn’t give us any kind of idea of what we are to understand “coolness” to be, or if it’s a scale, on what level of coolness “as fuck” occupies. The author’s perception of both might well be different to that of a casual reader, which in turn might well be different to that of a university professor, and will definitely be different to those unaware of the meaning of that particular idiom. If the reader is unsure of who or what “Mario” is, they are also now having to keep the assumption that he (or it) is “cool as fuck” in their active mind from the start, instead of being able to use all their thought processes in being led to draw their own conclusions or persuaded of the author’s opinion by the end.

* **The “Curse of Knowledge”**

We’ve got no further here than the first sentence. As satire, this is perfect; as an academic work? Not so much. College or university work has to meet academic standards. That includes no informal language or slang, and any specialised terminology needs to be properly defined within the context of the essay. There are far too many things the audience has to know before reading the essay, and assuming too much background knowledge of the audience is a cognitive bias known as [the “Curse of Knowledge”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge).

Also known as “the Curse of Expertise,” this is a cognitive bias where we incorrectly assume that everyone knows as much as we do on a given topic. When we know something, it can be hard to imagine what it would be like not knowing that piece of information. In turn, this makes it difficult to share our knowledge, because we struggle to understand the other party’s state of mind. Here, the author would think it incomprehensible that the audience would have no idea who or what “Mario” is, even though it is perfectly feasible that a sizeable amount won’t. The lesson here: don't always assume that your reader knows what you're talking about, as they probably don’t. Perchance.

* **The author**

Phil Jamesson is an actor and comedian who graduated from New York University in 2013 and began his entertainment career a few years later.  [His website](https://philjamesson.com/) is currently just a link to his social media outlets, and can be found on Reddit as u/PhilJamesson and the small and sleepy subreddit r/philjamesson. Although the original “Mario” tweet [went viral](https://www.trendsmap.com/twitter/tweet/1494724904129859588), so did some of his earlier work which made him painfully aware of what he aptly terms the [“Joke Stealing Economy”](https://medium.com/@phil.jamesson/the-next-step-5ff9589ac959).

[Perchance](https://perchance.org/) is a platform for creating and sharing random text generators, and can be discussed at r/perchance.

#Permaban
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Also known as Suspended. A ban from a Subreddit or sitewide that is permanent. Mods can permaban you from their subs but only Admin can permaban you sitewide from Reddit.

There is a school of thought that [Permanent bans on Reddit aren’t truly permanent](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/uakeb0/so_my_account_got_suspended/) but they are only valid for around 100 days as this is how long Reddit keeps your information on file for after logging in for the last time.

This page from the [Reddit privacy policy](https://i.redd.it/htu357f41a291.png) appears to confirm this theory in the section “Information We Collect Automatically”, but if you read it carefully, it says: **”Except for the IP address used to create your account**, Reddit will delete any IP addresses collected after 100 days.”

There really is a [lot of confusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/o2npiw/how_do_i_get_rid_of_a_reddit_ip_ban/) over how Reddit permanently suspends a user and [about what can be done](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2qjdop/eli5_what_is_the_purpose_of_banning_users_on/) if it happens, but ultimately only Admin know how it’s done and I haven’t been able to find any Admin comment on this whatsoever, so it’s staying secret.

As ageeing to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy is essentially signing a legal binding contract with Reddit, may I suggest you familiarise yourself with it once again:

#Philosophical Razors
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

In philosophy, a Razor is a rational principle used to shave off possible but unrealistic or unlikely explanations for a given phenomenon. There are generally accepted to be nine major logical razors, (though all branch off to several more related principles and corollaries) with the most famous ones being the first three on the list:

* [Occam's Razor](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_occam.27s_razor): *”Of two competing theories, the simpler explanation is more likely to be correct.”*
* [Hanlon’s Razor](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/4/#wiki_hanlon.2019s_razor): *”Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.”*
* [Duck Test](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_duck_test): *”If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.”*
* [Sagan Standard](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/7/#wiki_sagan_standard): *”Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”*
* [Hitchens’ Razor](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/4/#wiki_hitchens.2019_razor): *”What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.”*
* [Hume's Razor](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/4/#wiki_hume.27s_razor): *”Causes must be sufficiently able to produce the effect assigned to them.”*
* [Popper's Falsifiability Principle](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_popper.27s_falsifiability_principle): *”For a theory to be considered scientific, it must be possible to disprove or refute it.”*
* [Alder’s Razor aka Newton's Flaming Laser Sword](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/2/#wiki_alder.2019s_razor_aka_newton.27s_flaming_laser_sword): *”If something cannot be settled by experiment, it is not worth debating.”*
* [Grice's Razor](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/4/#wiki_grice.27s_razor): *”Address what the speaker actually meant, instead of addressing the literal meaning of what they actually said.”*

While a philosophical razor can be a useful mental shortcut that allows you to make decisions and solve problems quickly and easily, [it is not an unbreakable law or rule](https://www.intelligentspeculation.com/blog/philosophical-razors). Use them with care, lest you cut yourself (sorry). The general principle of all the razors is that simpler explanations are, all things being equal, generally better than more complex ones. However, a logical razor is not always right all of the time, and although the chance of it being right most of the time is more often than not, it is also true that there have been more than one scientific instance in which the most accurate explanation appeared to be the more complex one.

Because of this, the use of razors has met opposition over the years from people who have considered them too extreme, constricting or rash, and some have formulated counter-statements generally known as “anti-razors”.

* **Anti-Razors**

Anti-razors are most often warnings against the dangers of over-simplifying given data or events to the point where it is possible to actually misunderstand what the actual explanation of the data or the events is. More details are given in the individual entries where applicable, but as an example, let me give you three of the anti-razors countering Occam's Razor, which has been contested many times over the years:

* Chatton’s Anti-razor: *"If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added, and so on."*
* Crabtree's Bludgeon: *"No set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation, however complicated."*
* Hickam’s Dictum: *"A man can have as many diseases as he damn well pleases.”*

Of course, anti-razors themselves also have their flaws, and some people have tried to formulate different frameworks of deductive reasoning.

* **Alternatives to Razors**

There are many other [mental models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_models) of reasoning. The DECIDE framework was [designed in 2008](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5376683_DECIDE_A_Decision-Making_Model_for_More_Effective_Decision_Making_by_Health_Care_Managers) by Professor Kristina Guo, consisting of six (actually seven) steps:

* Defining the problem,
* Establishing the criteria,
* Considering the alternatives,
* Identifying the best alternative,
* Developing and implementing a plan of action,
* Evaluating the solution.

I’ve chosen this particular framework to highlight not only because it is simple and effective, but as it nicely exemplifies Llama’s Law V: *“When you’re demonstrating something that should happen to multiple items at once, there’ll always be one that doesn’t co-operate”.* Why? Because “Developing” and “Implementing” had to be shoehorned into one point, as DECIDIE isn’t a word and ruins the nice acrostic mnemonic they tried so hard to use. Let’s make Llama’s Law work, people!

So now I’ve introduced you to more models of thought than you will ever need anywhere, let alone on Reddit, my final proposal to you is that:

* **All models are wrong.**

*“All models are wrong, but some are useful”* is a famous quote often attributed to the British statistician [George E. P. Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong). His point was that we should focus more on whether something can be applied to everyday life in a useful manner rather than debating endlessly if an answer is correct in all cases. Seeing as we’re still, ostensibly, talking about Redditing in some way, I think we can safely ignore this aphorism in favour of the fun of endless, pointless debate with internet strangers about nothing meaningful.

* **Philosophical Razors on Reddit**

Reddit, as you would expect, takes philosophical razors [Very Seriously Indeed™](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4vplvh/eli5_razors_in_regard_to_philosophy/), and are commonly used in arguments throughout Reddit to try to prove someone else wrong, as if they were ammo to throw around “madlibs” style whenever someone says something that someone else disagrees with or suspects of having a bias. You, as a Redditor, are almost contractually bound to encounter or feel the need to use one during any debate. So, because I want *you*, dear reader, to be the superior Redditor at all times, the main logical razors all have their own separate entries at the links above to help make your Reddit discussions just that little bit easier to “win”.

However, let me reiterate that philosophical razors are rules-of-thumb rather than formal tools and ultimately have very little convincing power.  If your goal is to persuade someone of an alternative position, a razor may not be much help. But as you’re on Reddit, derailing an argument is a common diversionary tactic and this is where your new-found knowledge will shine above the rest. For instance, the next time someone quotes Occam's Razor at you, come back at them with [Crabtree's Bludgeon](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_crabtree.27s_bludgeon) or [Newton's Flaming Laser Sword](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_newton.27s_flaming_laser_sword) and watch them squirm - until they find the requisite anti-razor, that is. But by that time, you’ll have anticipated this and prepared your next set of razors to wield.

And it has been said that Hitchens’s Razor at least allows everybody to feel as smart as they thought they were, so “if that’s all you care about then [by all means, wield your blunt instrument slicing away until you’re the smartest guy in the room.”](https://randalrauser.com/2015/05/one-of-the-dumber-things-christopher-hitchens-said/)

Here’s a good list of subreddits concerning many aspects of [Philosophy, Religion and Spirituality](https://www.findareddit.com/category/philosophy-religion-and-spirituality) to get you started - but as always, do please read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) before contributing to any sub that is new to you, and unfortunately I cannot guarantee you’ll have the sufficient post and/or comment karma for their requirements.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/askphilosophy aims to provide serious, well-researched answers to philosophical questions. r/shittyaskphilosophy aimed to provide fairly serious but ridiculous answers to ridiculous philosophical questions but is currently banned for being unmoderated so would be a great candidate for adoption. In the meantime, r/shittyaskscience exists to “Ask Shitty Scientists your Shitty Science Questions”. As the word “razor” has different associations, I would be remiss in not mentioning r/wicked_edge: Reddit's straight razor and double edge shaving community, along with r/shaving. Other subs include r/RazorMains: a community for those who main Razor in Genshin Impact, and finally, r/razer: a sub made by Redditors to discuss RΛZΞR gaming hardware and systems.

#Ping
::Essentials for Newbies::

Also known as a Tag or Username Ping, this is simply mentioning another user in a comment anywhere on Reddit, using the u/ tag. For instance, typing u/llamageddon01 will send me a message and a link saying I was mentioned in that comment. If you're the subject of a conversation in the comments of a post you could get pinged quite a lot, so to avoid this, most people will refer to you as OP instead.

No doubt you will have been asked to read, or have even seen [“pinned” posts](https://i.redd.it/3vnu3pnh1n191.jpg) when you enter a subreddit. These are posts that a moderator (or even admin) has fixed to the top of a subreddit page, usually containing essential information on that subreddit. If you see a pinned post, always read it before posting or commenting on a sub. You should know that you will not see pinned posts if you Sort by ‘New’ or ‘Rising’.

As you can see from the screenshot, we have two here on r/NewToReddit: our general guide [**Reddit and Karma Explained**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/p8t966/reddit_and_karma_explained/) and our weekly Chat post. Pinned posts will have a lime green ‘pin’ icon and will show on top when you sort the Subreddit by ‘Hot’ or ‘Top”. Posts pinned in this way are also referred to as “sticky” or “stickied” posts.

* **How to pin a post to your profile**

You can also pin posts to your profile page, so that they’ll be the first thing anyone sees on accessing your profile. You can see how this looks [on a browser page](https://i.redd.it/k5om95v50n191.jpg) and here on [the app](https://i.redd.it/b07ng4cf0n191.jpg). If you’re an App user, you’ll need to open up your profile page in a web browser to pin posts.

* On your profile page, at the top should be a list of options [“Overview Posts Comments Saved”](https://i.redd.it/j3i1aksfawr81.jpg) etc.
* Choose Posts, and a list of your posts will appear.
* On each post, you should see some icons at the bottom of which one of them will be a three dots “hamburger” post overflow menu.
* One of the options in there will be [“Pin Post to Profile”](https://i.redd.it/7lxhn8h7qo191.jpg) (mine says “Unpin Post” because the one I chose from the list was already pinned).

Subreddits and profiles alike can only ever have two pinned posts at any one time, but these can be unpinned or re-pinned at will (by the mods of the sub or by you on your profile) and replaced with other posts at any time.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

As the word “pin” has different associations, I would be remiss in not mentioning r/EnamelPins \- a sub to and share Hat Pins, Lapel Pins, Pin Badges etc., r/Pins \- including a resource on how to collect, trade, design and make your own lapel pins, r/pinprojects \- aka The Craft & Enamel Pins Projects Subreddit, and r/PinCollecting \- they really like pins. Meanwhile, talking of “sticky”, r/recipes have the definitive list of [best sticky toffee pudding](https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1y8sva/give_me_your_best_sticky_toffee_pudding_recipe/) recipes. Oh yeah.

#Place
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Every year, Reddit holds a sitewide April Fools event, and in 2017 [they organised a project](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/62mesr/place/dfnw4rc/) which relied on collaboration between Redditors to create a piece of online art on a blank online “canvas” of 1 million pixels by placing one pixel (or “tiles”) at a time from a pre-set range of 16 colours in any part of the canvas. There were no instructions or goals given other than this enigmatic message:

* There is an empty canvas.
* You may place a tile upon it, but you must wait to place another.
* Individually you can create something.
* Together you can create something more.

The 1000x1000 pixel canvas updated in real-time, creating an ever-changing piece of digital, community-created art. The catch was that each Redditor was rate-limited for five minutes between placing their pixels, and could only watch in dismay as their perfectly chosen and carefully placed tile was overwritten by someone else. It soon became apparent that to create anything resembling anything other than chaos required organising groups of users with particular patterns in mind.

Called [“Place”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place), the event was so successful that in the 72 hours of being active, over [1 million users edited the canvas](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/place-part-two) placing a total of approximately 16.5 million pixels, and, at the time the experiment was ended, over 90,000 users were actively viewing or editing the canvas. It is said to have been [the largest collaborative art project in history](https://www.newsweek.com/reddit-place-internet-experiment-579049) at the time, and you can see it develop [step by step here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/62mesr/place/dfnw4rc/).

Redditors had been asking for years for Place’s return, and to everyone’s surprise the wish was [actually granted in April 2022](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/april-fools-on-reddit-is-no-joke-bringing-back-r-place?&), the announcement of which [was met with a](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/tqbf9w/bringing_back_rplace/) mixed reaction.

* **Place: 2022**

Once again, we were given an enigmatic message:

* Some have visited a canvas before.
* A place where togetherness created more.
* Now in numbers far greater, taking more space,
* It falls upon you to create a better place.

The premise was the same. A 1000x1000 pixel blank canvas to be filled one rate-limited pixel (or “tiles”) at a time with a choice of 16 colours, to be done over the longer period of 87 hours. But this time, Redditors knew what to expect, and having been given notice of the event, individual subreddits immediately began to co-ordinate in designing pixel art, forming large communities on Discord or creating new, temporary subreddits to work out how to create their chosen artworks.

There were also some surprise changes during the event. On the second and third day, the canvas and the colour palette were expanded twice, until the final change where the canvas stayed the same size but the [only colour available was white](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/twget3/whats_going_on_with_the_whitening_over_on_rplace/) for the last hour.

A less pleasant surprise was [longer timeouts and even some bans from the subreddit (and consequently, the canvas)](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/tvta11/how_it_really_be/) having to be given in rare instances.

* **When is a cat not a cat?**

In accordance with *”Llama’s Law VI”* [“No matter how wholesome a crowdsourced artwork is, someone will always add a peen”](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_.201Cno_matter_how_wholesome_a_crowdsourced_artwork_is.2C_someone_will_always_add_a_peen.201D), pixelated private parts ([mostly butts at first but then… you know…](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/tvrm9j/and_then_a_giant_penis_swept_down_decimating/)) soon invaded the canvas and nothing was immune. As seen above, some people trying to combat the pixel porn were accidentally given long timeouts, but so were some people who were idly contributing to what they thought was a [cute cat](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/marsey-the-cat) picture.

It wasn’t. This was the mascot of an ex-Reddit community that had moved offline [who were trying to add their banned URL as a text drawing](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tydvgz/whats_going_on_with_rplace_reddits_mod_team_and/) which Reddit Admin stepped in to remove. The sheer bewilderment [was apparent](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tur91x/whats_the_deal_with_people_getting_banned_for/) at first, before turning into short-lived but full-blown [drama](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/tv2lmx/reddit_adminmoderator_caught_cheating_in_rplace/).

The issue behind (ha!) the [plethora of pixelated porn](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/tvt0rk/ass_on_french_flag_keeps_getting_censored_and/) stemmed from the intervention of some [Twitch streamers mobilising their communities](https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a39636815/what-is-r-place-explained/) to co-ordinate the placing of pre-determined pixel creations, many using Bot accounts to do so. As you would expect, [some were lovely, some were fun, some were neither](https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/meme-review/how-reddits-rplace-brought-the-internet-together-for-four-glorious-days-of-war-on-canvas), and some were simply just there to deface or destroy other creations.

* **Territorial wars and truces**

But this also brought some very disparate groups together using Discord to co-ordinate real-time attempts to rescue targeted artworks. Some of these communities previously had very little - if anything - in common with each other until the issue of ensuring particular pixels were kept certain colours for a short period of time became vital. Many unlikely alliances were formed, and this comprehensive [timeline of events](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LOLuyHUL3VYt0D9fsIUtrklpfewX6wHKZ73Li_7iGWo/edit?usp=sharing) shows many groups joining forces to defend their territories alongside that of the [Welsh flag](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wales/comments/twfvie/wales_right_before_the_purge_of_place/).

Talking of flags, this animation of [the first few hours of Place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/ttts0k/first_hours_of_2022_rplace_animated/) shows the massive amount of goodwill towards Ukraine by allowing their flag to span the entire width of the canvas before being mostly replaced. Many national flags were represented but as this is my encyclopaedia, I’m giving special mention to the [creation of the Welsh flag (y ddraig goch)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wales/comments/ttqnsq/5_years_ago_we_created_y_ddraig_goch_on_rplace/) as the group I contributed to even made it onto [the venerable BBC Wales](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-wales-61004680).

Also from the Welsh Place Discord group members came a YouTube video, [“The Dragon That Could”](https://youtu.be/Zig1NFfJjPY), while the intrepid Redditor u/ohmegamega as well as the timeline of events linked above also made a [complete Timelapse of the creation of the flag](https://youtu.be/bi7_ahPAjnk) where if you look closely you can see my desperate fight against the lil pink peen invader of our lovely red dragon, and later against the [“amogus” \[sic\] invasion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmongUs/comments/twiuqu/rplace_had_around_35k_little_among_us_in_it/).

* **More timelines…**

But enough words. Let’s see the art from r/place.

And finally, a dizzying [high quality Timelapse](https://rplace.space/) along with a resource of all the pictures (1 every 30 seconds) used to create it: [https://rplace.space/combined/](https://rplace.space/combined/).

* **Place stuff I didn’t have a place for above…**

Reddit finally reveal [how they built place](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/vcyeqi/how_we_built_rplace/).

Despite the existence of r/placecanada, Canadian Redditors had problems [with their flag](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/twqjwj/timelapse_of_canada/) which even made it to the [Vancouver City News](https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2022/04/04/maple-leaf-canada-reddit/).

There are two websites where you can look up a Reddit username to see where they placed pixels and if they had any remaining on the final canvas:

#Platinum Awards
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

If someone gives you a Platinum award, you will receive a month of free premium Reddit, giving you a month of ad-free browsing, r/lounge access and 700 Reddit coins. The coins will not expire once the month is up, and, like other premium awards, the time stacks up if you get other premium awards during that month.

Platinum is not like any other Reddit premium award in that you might not get the coins immediately, depending on other factors such as any awards you might have previously won. Those who pay for their premium subscription get 700 regular Reddit coins delivered every 31 days, and those who are awarded Platinum get theirs the same way.

Getting your 700 Platinum coins also [depends upon when in the month you won the award](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/kr7wzl/the_code_is_unfrozen_heres_your_first_super_short/gi8rmjn/). This is ambiguously called the ‘Billing Cycle’ and to view yours, go to: User settings --> Subscriptions --> Subscription status.

You will see the message “Your Premium Subscription will automatically renew at the beginning of your next billing cycle. If your subscription ends, you will have Premium until (Date).” If you won Platinum, your subscription will end on that date.

Yes, it’s confusing. So. Let’s say you are a Redditor currently with no premium, paid for or gifted.

* You get 4 awards in the first week of January in this order: 1. Platinum, 2. Platinum, 3. Gold, 4. Platinum. Hooray! 13 whole weeks of Reddit Premium in total!
* However, in January you will only get 800 coins, 700 of which might not even be given straight away. The 100 gold is given immediately, the platinum is given as described above. That’s the coins from your awards numbers 1 and 3. You get your first four weeks of Reddit Premium.
* Sometime in February, four weeks after your first coin delivery you’ll get another 700 coins, from award number 2. By now you are into your second four weeks of Reddit Premium.
* Sometime in March, four weeks after your second coin delivery, you get nothing. You are into your ninth week of Reddit Premium; the gold week. But you already had your 100 gold coins in week 1 because they were given immediately you won the award.
* One week later in March, maybe even April, you get 700 coins from award number 4, the final platinum.
* Your Reddit Premium then ends after 13 weeks.

You will be notified by Reddit when your coins arrive with a message like:  *Gadzooks! Your monthly Coins have been delivered! Your 700 monthly Coins have been added to your balance! Thank you for supporting Reddit as a Premium member!*

#Poe’s Law
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

An Eponymous Law named for a user calling himself "Nathan Poe" on a Christian forum in 2005. Basically, it claims that no matter how hard you try to be sarcastic or make a parody, some people will still think you were serious.

Poe, an agnostic, was engaging with some creationists about the origins of everything. However, the Internet has always been the Internet and there were other users who were not creationists but were instead having fun writing satirical posts on the topic. The problem was that the satire was so good it became hard to tell which posts were sincerely defending creationism and which were just trolling.

Poe then [called the phenomenon “Poe’s Law”](https://www.christianforums.com/threads/big-contradictions-in-the-evolution-theory.1962980/page-3#post-17606580) stating “Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is [uttrerly \[sic\] impossible](https://i.redd.it/8m20poikaa291.jpg) to parody a Creationist in such a way that *someone* won't mistake for the genuine article.”

Over time, this has been expanded to encompass any kind of extremism where [parody and reality are indistinguishable from each other](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/List_of_Poe%27s_Law_examples). Poe was not the first to notice this phenomenon. In 1983, [user “Jerry Schwarz” on a Usenet group](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/poes-law) posted: "If you submit a satiric item without this symbol - a sideways smile, :-) - no matter how obvious the satire is to you, do not be surprised if people take it seriously."

Unfortunately, a form of “meta-trolling” has emerged where people deliberately post something offensive and when called out on it, [hide behind Poe’s Law](https://www.wired.com/2017/06/poes-law-troll-cultures-central-rule/) claiming that their offending statement had been a joke and that the reader is just being hypersensitive, when it clearly wasn’t and the reader really isn’t.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/AteTheOnion is a glorious repository of people falling for satire, and r/poeslawinaction, now sadly defunct, also collected notable examples.

#“Pog”; “Poggers”
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A word posted when the the words “great!”, “super!”, “fantastic!” and other terms used to convey excitement or sudden joy either aren’t enough, not cool enough to use, or maybe even too long to type. It’s a shortening of [pogchamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PogChamp); the name of an emote on Twitch. Incidentally, “Pog” is an initialism of ‘Passionfruit, Orange, Guava’ from the eponymous 90s playground game.  [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk\_caps\_(game)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_caps_(game)). There was an erroneous idea a while back that Pog originally meant ‘Play(er) of the Game’ which was roundly debunked as that usage came about much later, though that meaning has since stuck around.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/POG is a community for people to share their collection of Milkcaps, Pogs, or Slammer Whammers.

#Poop Knife
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Oh dear. You got here, then. I suppose this day had to come. Ok, here we go.  r/Confession is a place to admit your wrongdoings, acknowledge your guilt, and alleviate your conscience, and in January 2018, a Redditor did just that in the infamous [“Poop Knife” post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/ke8skw/the_poop_knife/). The original post was deleted but the [comments remain](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/7p8puq/light_i_was_22_years_old_when_i_learned_that_not/) for ~~posterior~~ posterity.

Incredibly, you should know that the ‘poop knife’ is [now an actual thing](https://www.originalpoopknife.com/). Complete with other related merch. You thought you’d seen it all? You have now.

* **Number 2** ***or*** **Drop a deuce.**

Reddit, as you might expect, loves a good story about excrement and if you do too, then r/AskReddit and r/NoStupidQuestions are your [dookie destinations](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9k25vr/unhealthy_people_of_reddit_what_was_your_worst/) with enough [poopular tales](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3zksyh/reddit_what_is_a_pooping_pro_tip_that_everyone/)and [stinky surveys](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/u6po22/do_people_actually_check_their_toilet_paper_after/) for you to read [while on the throne](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ex4z9/why_do_people_read_while_shitting/) no matter how [often you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jo84o/how_often_should_one_poop_how_often_do_you_poop/).

That last link references a notorious [IAmA from 2011](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jo5at/iama_guy_that_hasnt_pooped_in_the_month_of_august/) which OP kindly posted a [sequel to](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jp44z/iama_guy_that_hasnt_pooped_in_the_month_of_august/). Not to be outdone, several years later r/AMA featured a similar [tale of woe](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/dzheft/i_just_went_two_and_a_half_months_without/). Even r/dataisbeautiful has [gotten into the act](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/cimb8u/ive_tracked_every_poop_i_have_taken_in_the_last_5/) \- illustrated, of course.

* **The age-old debate: over, or under?**

The internet has always been a centre for serious debate and one of its first and longest-standing conflicts was about [the correct orientation of a roll of toilet paper](https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/the-correct-way-to-hang-toilet-paper-according-to-.html) with respect to the bathroom wall. Should the roll be either hung *over* the toilet roll holder (with the end piece being away from the wall), or *under* (with the end piece being close to the wall)?

[Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-great-toilet-paper-debate) traces the earliest online reference to June 1997, though the debate itself goes much further back. I was a Prefect in my Junior School in 1969 and one of my duties (heh) was to put new rolls of the very popular [San Izal toilet paper](https://sheffielder.net/2020/04/02/izal-the-invisible-guardian-against-risks-to-health/) in the girls’ toilets every day. I distinctly recall having a debate with the Head Girl who insisted that the piece that hangs down had to be against the wall as that meant the “smooth” side kept cooler, but I disagreed for reasons I can’t recall now.

Incidentally, it was popular not because of it being toilet paper but because it made very good tracing paper. As toilet paper, it was… terrible. One side was slippery, the other side was scratchy. [Similar stuff exists today](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/osevid/the_most_absurdly_thin_toilet_paper_i_have_ever/).

Anyway, if she’s reading this now (hello, Susan), can I say I was perfectly justified in my choice as, in 2010, when I was at the grand re-opening of the refurbished Savoy Hotel in London, their toilet rolls were presented on the holders with the end piece neatly folded into a point with a shiny green “Savoy” sticker on to hold it in place, *facing outwards*. Nobody can argue with the Savoy, being the bastion of good manners and “properness” that it is. Ha.

And if that isn’t enough evidence for either Susan or you (heathen) then the original patent by Seth Wheeler, the inventor of perforated toilet paper, [clearly shows the paper going up and over the roll](https://www.businessinsider.com/patent-shows-right-way-to-hang-toilet-paper-2015-3?r=US&IR=T).

* **Serious Crap.**

Do you want Fatbergs? Because flushable wipes are [how you get Fatbergs](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HgpCUVyrY1g). If it isn’t human waste or toilet roll, DON’T FLUSH IT, FOLKS! When it says ‘flushable’ on the packet that only means it is capable of being flushed, [not that it’s advisable to flush it](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/fatberg-london-belgravia-cadogan-place-sewer-thames-water-b1444222.html).

r/nosleep is a place for Redditors to share scary stuff, and they [absolutely know](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pq18xf/do_you_know_what_a_fatberg_is_part_one/) all about [fatbergs](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/preqb9/do_you_know_what_a_fatberg_is_part_two/) and how to make them [even worse than reality](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pv4lhb/do_you_know_what_a_fatberg_is_part_three/).

* **Some real shit.**

In a vain attempt to be a little more serious after the excesses of the links in the first paragraph, here’s the bottom line (heh) on [how long you can go without pooping](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-long-can-you-go-without-pooping) and if you want to know just what’s in the deposit you make at the porcelain bank, [Vox digs all the dirt](https://www.vox.com/2015/1/22/7871579/poop-feces) with 9 surprising faecal facts.

Back to Reddit, and r/ibs takes a look at the [Bristol stool scale](https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/rqdrdn/the_bristol_stool_scale/), while r/Parenting is a place you [can discuss toilet training](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ar6uwj/3_year_old_refusing_to_poo_now_has_impacted_bowel/) with other parents. Finally, let me leave you with a serious post from r/IAmA which discusses the realities of living after [bowel cancer](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/luvt2l/im_a_36yo_who_has_had_bowel_cancer_and_had_2/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/poop: all things poop and r/ratemypoo: for rating poop. Because of course Reddit needs at least two subs on this (faecal) matter. And r/ToiletPaper.

#Popper's Falsifiability Principle
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Popper's Falsifiability Principle is a saying commonly known as an “Eponymous Law”, but more accurately as a [Philosophical Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor) that reads [”For a theory to be considered scientific, it must be possible to disprove or refute it.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability).

Applied broadly, this particular principle suggests that science should attempt to disprove a theory, rather than attempt to continually support theoretical hypotheses. Karl Popper (1902 – 1994) illustrated this through the famous story of the black swan: “Europeans for thousands of years had observed millions of white swans. Using inductive evidence, we could come up with the theory that all swans are white. However, exploration of Australasia introduced Europeans to black swans.”

Poppers' point is this: no matter how many observations are made which confirm a theory, there is always the possibility that a future observation could refute it. Popper proposed an alternative scientific method based on falsification. However many confirming instances there are for a theory, it only takes one counter observation to falsify it, so therefore the scientist should attempt to disprove their theory rather than attempt to continually prove it.

The advantage of Popper's idea is that all truths can be falsified when more knowledge and resources are available. Falsifiability works because science progresses when a theory is shown to be wrong and a new theory is introduced which better explains the phenomena. This means that even long accepted theories such as Gravity, Relativity and Evolution are increasingly challenged and adapted.

While a philosophical razor can be a useful mental shortcut that allows you to make decisions and solve problems quickly and easily, it is not an unbreakable law or rule, and the major disadvantage of falsifiability is that it is very strict in its definitions and does not take into account the contributions of sciences that are observational and descriptive.  [It has also been said that](https://www.newscientist.com/people/karl-popper/) falsifiability is hard to apply in practice, too vague to differentiate science from pseudoscience and bears little resemblance to what scientists really do.

* **Popper's Falsifiability Principle on Reddit**

Reddit, as you would expect, takes Popper's Falsifiability Principle [Very Seriously Indeed™](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/ledvs8/popper_theory_of_falsification_flaws/) and it is frequently [examined](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5ln4lt/eli5_the_concept_of_falsifiability_i_just_cant/) in many [different subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/2isjz2/what_exactly_is_wrong_with_falsificationism/).

#Porn
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A word with two very different and distinct meanings on Reddit. Many Subreddits with the "Porn" suffix are focused on collecting media of the best or highest quality and not in the slightest bit NSFW. [r/sfwpornnetwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/sfwpornnetwork/wiki/network) will be your starting point here. [Link for those who would prefer to avoid visiting subreddits with the word "porn" in their titles](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSillySuffix/wiki/index). Unfortunately, neither of these lists are remotely up to date.

For the second meaning there is r/NSFW411. NSFW, obviously. You do have an NSFW filter at your disposal (the Settings option in your profile) should you wish. You cannot enter a sub (or profile) marked NSFW without going through a warning screen first.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

#Post
::Essentials for Newbies::

A Reddit Post is the broad term for any content shared on Reddit, whether it is a story, link, image, gif, poll or video that is made in a subreddit for others to comment on. Always read the rules before posting on an unfamiliar Subreddit. The main entry on posting is [Participating on Reddit: Posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/p8t966/reddit_and_karma_explained/h9ss4vt/).

#Post Flair
::Essentials for Newbies::

Some subreddits give you the option - or even require you - to add a Post Flair when posting. There will be a drop-down menu of the choices available to you when you submit your post. This is to help people quickly scan posts and see what they are about, because if you click the Post Flair, you should be able to see ALL the posts that have been tagged with that same flair. In effect, it helps organize the subreddit into topics.

#Posting Images on Reddit
::Essentials for Newbies::

When you go to make a Post (‘Create Post’ pencil on paper icon or the ‘+’ tab bottom centre on mobile) from the front page of a Subreddit, you are given 5 options: Link, Image, Video, Text, and Poll. You can either upload your own image from your device or use Imgur’s “share” link (more on this below). The option you choose will then talk you through the steps.

Please note that some communities don't have image posting enabled, and those options will be greyed out. You also should be aware that there are certain domains that Reddit have blacklisted and any links to them will automatically get removed as they're not approved for use on the site.

NSFW subreddits and profiles are not allowed to use Reddit's native image and video uploader, and must host videos elsewhere and make link posts.

If you’re on mobile and have problems uploading an image, try going to Settings --> App --> Reddit and allow permissions for files and media.

* **Using Imgur**

Reddit's image hosting is a bit weird at times. Sometimes you can directly upload your image through the "image" tab in the uploader, but other times you're required to use the "link" tab and use that to upload your image to the sub. Most people use Imgur for this as it’s preferred by Reddit. It’s easy to use and you don’t need an account there. Just head on over to [https://imgur.com](https://imgur.com/), upload your photo and post it as "hidden". Then copy the image’s direct link and paste it into the "link" tab of the upload section of the post and voilà, your image will be uploaded!

Don't use the "copy link" which shows once the upload is completed, instead do a right click and click "copy image location". The result is much better, especially for mobile users, as seen in these examples:

With copy link: [https://imgur.com/225EVr4](https://imgur.com/225EVr4) With copy image location: [https://i.imgur.com/225EVr4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/225EVr4.jpg)

* **Other Tutorials**

There are more details and instructions on [our sister sub here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/tc63p7/how_to_create_an_image_post_new_reddit_and_app/)

[This is a simple explanation](https://imgur.com/a/ZFcg0Fn) of how to post pictures on Reddit. There’s [another one here too](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/7az5gp/posting_images/). There are also [a number of guides on Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-add-a-picture-to-a-post-on-Reddit) and Google led me [to this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5hrXIiRSeY) which is short but to the point.

* **Image Gallery**

There are details and instructions on creating a gallery post on [our sister sub here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/tc6amr/how_to_create_a_gallery_post_multiple_images_in/).

To post an Image Gallery on Reddit, all you have to do is visit the community you want to post in, and then follow the steps below:

1. Tap on the “Create Post” button, and select the ‘Image Post’ option from the tabs.
2. Select up to 20 images or GIFs, and rearrange to your liking.
3. Include a post title, add an optional caption (up to 180 characters), or URL, for each image or GIF.
4. Tap ‘post.’

Note: You can also apply a ‘Spoiler’ or ‘Not Safe For Work’ tag to Image Galleries if you need to. Again, Image Galleries may not be available in all communities.

* **Other Media**

For GIFs/MP4s people use [https://gfycat.com/upload](https://gfycat.com/upload) and will make a link post to the URL of what they uploaded.

If your subreddit is NSFW or private, images and videos on it must be hosted on an external site (like Imgur), as they [can’t be hosted on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/i03jfz/how_can_i_allow_video_posts_on_my_subreddit/). However, an NSFW account might be able to use the mobile app to post images, [but not the desktop browser](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/s5v43z/upload_images_in_my_community/).

#Potato Quality
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A phrase used in an apology for, or accusation of an image or video being pixelated, blurry or other forms of very low quality. The exact origin of this usage is unclear but is generally credited to a comment on a YouTube video from 2008 which asked “did you record this with a potato?”. However, [B3ta](https://b3ta.com/challenge/PhotoshopUK/) and other digital art and meme communities have referred to the well known image-altering software as “potatoshop” [long before that](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=potatoshop).

An interesting discussion which brought up several anecdotes of people using the word “potato” to mean poor quality over the years [went on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3yzgku/where_did_the_term_potato_quality_come_from/), again with no real conclusion for the origin of today’s usage.

The phrase has become a [Snowclone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowclone) as internet communities dealing with audio or video often use the disclaimer “recorded with a toaster” or another contextually absurd object such as a calculator or microwave to acknowledge they know the quality is lower than they would ideally like.

#Powermods
::Jargon and Slang::

You might see the term “Powermods” from time to time. This refers to a Redditor that moderates several large subreddits, but as is often the case on Reddit, it’s an innocuous word that is not quite how it appears. The highly derogatory term has been around for [some time](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/s717g5/list_of_reddit_powermods/), but became widespread in early 2020 [when a selected list of Mod usernames](https://www.protocol.com/reddit-powermods-war) was circulated as being the people [secretly “in charge” of Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/gkkfg5/updated_and_sanitized_six_powermods_control_118/).

Because drama-loving Redditors will Reddit, this soon spread round many communities, each time escalating a little bit more into an unholy mixture of scandal, rampant accusations and conspiracy theory. It even generated a [Powermods Starterpack](https://www.reddit.com/r/starterpacks/comments/pcqhpu/reddit_powermod_starterpack/) before finally fizzling out.

Are Powermods something to be worried about? [Well, as “Cracked” put it](https://www.cracked.com/article_29675_the-secret-war-against-reddits-moderator-oligarchy.html): *“So how scared should people be of the unlimited power of Powermods destroying the last bastion of internet democratic information transfer? Not very. Like a scheming PTA mom or oppressive HOA cabal, Powermods only have any clout in the pettiest way possible. A quick glance at the kind of subreddits these five mods lord over shows not a single political, financial, or news subreddit in the bunch. The only iron-fisted oligarchy they have is over the Very Online Industry, leaving the karma billionaires to harness their Orwellian powers over oddly wholesome memes and animals being derps.”*

#Powerups
::Features of Reddit::

In 2020, Reddit announced the testing of [a new concept](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/iicyi1/testing_a_new_concept_with_select_subreddit/) which at first was only available [in a few Subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/l0duo5/reddit_is_testing_powerups_paid_perks_for/). This proved to be popular and for a while, many subreddits had a [banner blazing lightning](https://i.redd.it/4cmzotx93cc91.jpg) across the top or in their [sidebar](https://i.redd.it/0r8uzgjc3cc91.jpg) “advertising” for Reddit Power-ups.

However, in July 2022, it [was decided](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/vt002w/powering_down_powerups/) to retire the concept in favour of rolling out some of the benefits across Reddit as a whole, and the [official announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/vyyne6/changelog_outerspace_gifs_in_comments_fixing_the/) followed shortly after.

* **What did Power-ups do?**

A subreddit’s members could become “patrons” of the subreddit by buying monthly subscription-based power-ups. A subreddit then had access to new features when it met a minimum threshold of power-up subscriptions; our little sub needed 25 per month minimum. When the requisite number of users - known as “Community Heroes” - had powered up a community, some new features were able to be unlocked for everyone to use, provided they were enabled by the mods:

* GIFs in comments (not applicable in NewToReddit).
* New Reddit emojis, called “snoomojis”.
* More features such as better video quality (not applicable in NewToReddit).
* Achievement icons next to your username and in your profile when accessed from the powered up sub.
* A new, free Highlighting Award “Power-ups Comment” was occasionally given out randomly alongside the normal free award, but this appears to have been discontinued at time of writing.

If the monthly power-ups dropped to below 25, the features were removed until we achieved 25 once more; this happened twice to my recollection. We never had more than 26 at any one time but some of the larger subs had hundreds, yet received no extra benefits than we did by just making the threshold.

* **Our Community Heroes**

Our first Community Heroes were our long time lovely friends u/vancityace, u/MasterYoshi5and u/Vapidmusings, and while the power-ups feature was running, each time they - or any of our subsequent Community Heroes (except the five who chose to remain anonymous) - posted or commented in r/NewToReddit, you would see a ‘Shazam’ style lightning bolt next to their usernames, a bright red frame on their snoo thumbnail on posts and comments, along with a special mention in the Power-up Community Heroes sidebar. We also gave our Community Heroes a choice of user flair. There was a list of all our Community Heroes in our sidebar and I would give them all a hug if I could for supporting our little help sub at the time.

* **How you could get a monthly Power-up**

Paying Premium users were given one free power-up per month, and anyone else had to purchase a power-up subscription for $4.99 a month by clicking the "Become a Hero" button on the sidebar. If a paying Premium user wanted to power-up multiple subreddits, they had to buy a separate power-up subscription for each additional subreddit.

Power-up Heroes ware not committed to keep powering up the subreddit they first chose. They could move their monthly power-up to a different subreddit by going to their settings and selecting the Premium tab:  [https://www.reddit.com/settings/premium](https://www.reddit.com/settings/premium) where they could see the option to manage power-ups at the bottom.

* **Important Stuff they had to know**

Before considering becoming a Community Hero, it was important to understand the following from [https://www.redditinc.com/policies/previews-terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/previews-terms) :

*Power-ups are a subscription membership. When you purchase Power-ups, your subscription is subject to the Reddit Premium and Virtual Goods Agreement. Purchasing Power-ups does not provide you with the right to post or comment in that subreddit. Participating subreddits are run by moderators and your ability to post or comment, or the removal of a post or comment, is at the discretion of that subreddit’s moderator(s). Moderators also have the ability to opt out of certain perks, including GIFs in comments and Emojis. When you purchase Power-ups, it is possible the subreddit will not reach the Power-up total necessary to unlock additional perks.*

More information is available here:

* [https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403699823629-Powerups](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403699823629-Powerups)
* [https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403386953108-What-are-Powerups-](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403386953108-What-are-Powerups-)

Before giving any money to Reddit, please familiarise yourself with the full [Reddit Premium and Virtual Goods agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/premium-and-virtual-goods-agreement).

* **I was a little controversial here.**

If a user was considering purchasing power-ups for us or any other community, I suggested they might want to think about buying Reddit Premium at $5.99 a month instead. That is $1 extra each month but came with a monthly power-up and [many other benefits too](https://www.reddit.com/premium). Reddit Premium members use Reddit free of adverts, get 700 Reddit Coins a month (plus first-time subscribers get an extra 1,000 Reddit Coins just for signing up), exclusive items for dressing-up your Snoovatar, exclusive awards, custom app icons, and access to the lovely r/lounge.

#Preemptive Ban
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

As you already know, every subreddit has its own rules, post format, karma requirements and moderators all totally unique to that community, and very few subreddits will tell you their minimum karma level basically to avoid spammers, throwaway troll accounts or low-quality participants. It doesn’t take much for an idiot to make it vital for both Reddit and subreddit mods to tighten our overall criteria which in turn makes us feel impenetrable to the new user. The system isn’t fun to be caught in or fun to enforce, but because people suck and are spoiling the fun for others, we can’t tell from the onset who’s going to do that or who’s going to be an asset to the community.

Think of it this way: because one bad egg once ruined the omelette, we now have to crack each egg open and examine it individually before allowing it into the mix.

* **Troll Taming**

Mods are [increasingly using tactics](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/nu2hs6/the_issue_with_karma_farming_bots_overunning_subs/) to remove shills and low-quality participants from their subs before they can start their mayhem, but another problem that some mods increasingly face in today’s divisive political and social climate is “Brigading” - where people from a particular sub go to post on another sub that they do not usually frequent in a deliberately disruptive manner without intending any form of meaningful contribution.

Individuals brigading are generally not there for discussion. They're there to shout down others, belittle and attack, and for a mod who’s subreddit has a specific ideological alignment where they see someone making trouble whose posting history suggests an opposing viewpoint, it’s not unreasonable to make the leap that maybe that person is just there to make trouble. This has become such a problem for some subs, they are having to implement [preemptive banning](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskModerators/comments/ox9lkj/im_getting_permanently_banned_in_subs_across_the/) to try and “cut it off at the pass”.

* **No clear solution**

Most people would agree that these measures are justified if the user is normally posting to a sub that's for nothing but trolling, or their history suggests they’re in the sub with deliberate intent of acting in bad faith. A serious socio-political history sub doesn't need the "alternative viewpoint" of a regular contributor to a sub dedicated to holocaust denial, for example, and it’s fair to say that it’s better to just deny some people access before they come in and start making waves of untreated sewage in their lovely clear pool. The problem is that defining “some people” isn’t always obvious.

It’s a problem with no clear solution, so the best way to guard against a preemptive ban is not to do anything that will warrant one in the first place - although sometimes again, it’s [not so obvious](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModerationMediation/comments/nrewsa/banned_for_participating_in_another_but_unnamed/) as that, especially as you won’t often know if one subreddit has another on their blacklist.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Whether this is fair or unfair can be debated in subs like r/TheoryOfReddit, r/RedditCensors, r/ModsAreKillingReddit, r/loligotbanned4this and the many other subs that exist to discuss or complain about Reddit. Reddit loves being meta, and it doesn’t get much more meta than complaining in the very place you’re complaining about. Be mindful that there are subreddits that have these types of sub on their blacklist and will ban you just for posting in them, so you might want to consider using an Alt for such complaining.

#Premium Reddit
::Features of Reddit::

Pay monthly to support Reddit [https://www.reddit.com/premium](https://www.reddit.com/premium) and get ad-free browsing and exclusive stuff for your Redditing. Small periods of Reddit Premium (with a smaller range of exclusive stuff) can be gifted to other Redditors by giving certain Awards. You get a Trophy on your Profile and a shield next to your Profile name when you have Premium Reddit, and your [Snoovatar acquires a golden glow](https://i.redd.it/slcy3jw9j1d81.jpg) with little sparkles rising from it. Buying or being gifted Premium also entitles you to access certain private subreddits for the duration of your premium time.

Any time you’re not sure when your premium time will end, go to your profile (press on your Snoo), and a menu will drop down: "my profile", "coins", etc. Under the heading that says “Reddit Premium” it will say “valid until X” where X is the final premium day. Alternatively, this link to your profile on “Old Reddit” should have this info on the top right hand side:

#Privacy Issues
::Features of Reddit::

Reddit is very private and very public all at the same time. Be very careful what you share here. Anyone can go to your profile (by clicking on your name) and see your previous posts and comments. Reddit is open to anyone to read; you don’t have to join or be a member to see the vast majority of things posted here which makes it a tempting target for other internet outlets craving for new content. Reddit is not immune to search engines like other social media; it’s a paradox as we can be an extremely supportive place and very conducive to openness, but Reddit is also very “googleable” and for the more determined person, [even posts that you may delete can be resurrected](https://marketedly.com/read-deleted-reddit-comments-posts/).

There are also websites that archive old or deleted Reddit posts, and as Reddit supports an API to access data, people have built tools using that API to make scraping data easier. [https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

* **Deliberately Relinquishing Your Privacy**

Some Subreddits and Reddit Campaigns because of their nature require you to relinquish some degree of privacy. For instance, r/secretsanta and the now defunct redditgifts.com were started in 2009 to provide a Secret Santa exchange for the Reddit community, performing many gift exchanges over the years until it was [discontinued in 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/nw2hs6/sunsetting_secret_santa_and_reddit_gifts/).

While that’s now gone, there are still many subreddits where gift exchanges, financial assistance and random acts of charity are performed where you’ll have to give your personal details out to participate. You should always check the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) and information of the Subreddit or Campaign in question to see how comfortable you are with their levels of security before making a commitment.

You might also come across Redditors on your travels that you mutually feel you want RL interactions with, and in such cases make sure any personal traceable stuff (eMail, real names etc) is only shared in private messages with them.

* **Brigading**

If you believe a person or group of people are following you around Reddit with the express intention of downvoting, negatively commenting or generally harassing you, this action is called “Brigading”, and is a serious offence on Reddit. Proving it, however, is not so easy, and your best course of action here is simply to ignore it. Redditors generally forget personal vendettas quite quickly when they aren’t fun (i.e. not provoking a response) anymore.

Brigading is also when a group of users "invade" a specific subreddit and flood it with down / upvotes in order to damage karma dynamics on the targeted sub. This is easier to prove, and as Reddit regards this as being Content or [Vote Manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/9/#wiki_vote_manipulation), anyone who is attempting to incite a brigade will be banned. Anyone participating in a brigade is also liable to be banned. See Reddit’s [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). You should also see the related link in the **See Also:** section at the end of this entry.

* **Harassment**

Harassment is the action of repeatedly messaging users on or off of Reddit, pinging them repeatedly, or following them around and commenting on everything that they say either in a passive-aggressive manner or outright maliciousness. Anyone who deliberately pings the subject of a post where the usernames are blocked out will be banned. If you believe you are being unfairly targeted in this way, you need to collect the links as evidence and report it directly to Reddit at either:

* [https://www.reddithelp.com/](https://www.reddithelp.com/) or
* [https://www.reddit.com/contact/](https://www.reddit.com/contact/)

I recommend everyone familiarise themselves with [Reddit’s Policy on Harassment & Bullying](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043071072-Do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully).

* **Doxxing**

To ‘dox’ someone means to release their personal or private information that may prove harmful or embarrassing. This can happen in the real world, but the internet has made it easier both to find and release this information to a wide audience. Doxxing may reveal someone's personal information like their home address or workplace, social security or phone number, private correspondence or pictures, criminal history, IP address, or other details. Some people fail to realize that information they share on social media or other sites may be “scraped” and used against them, potentially opening themselves up to unwelcome public disclosure, identity theft, cyberbullying, stalking, or threats to their personal safety.

Harassers and stalkers use several tools and techniques to gather information about their targets, but since these are mostly public and easy to use, [we can also use them ourselves, on ourselves, as a preventative measure](https://guides.accessnow.org/self-doxing.html#self-doxing-to-prevent-doxing). You should also see the link on Doxxing in the **See Also:**section at the end of this entry.

* **Data Request**

You can request a copy of your Reddit data and information, including IP Address Logs, and an archive of all your posts including deleted ones.

* Go to [https://www.reddit.com/settings/data-request](https://www.reddit.com/settings/data-request)
* Enter the Username of the Reddit account you’d like to request data from.
* Follow the instructions and click ‘Submit’
* Once it’s ready, you'll be sent a private message with a link to download your data.

You should also familiarise yourself with [Reddit’s Official Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy).

* **Deleting your User History**

One of our lovely helpful users [wrote a guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/ppocu4/reddit_to_be_anonymous_or_not/) on whether to be anonymous on Reddit or not which is well worth a read, and one of their suggestions was to use r/PowerDeleteSuite to wipe all your account clean. They describe it as this:

*Feel like scrubbing your user history? Use this simple script to edit and delete your reddit user history. This script can: \* Export a CSV file of any items it finds \* Remove Submissions \* Remove Comments \* Edit Comment / Self Posts You can also filter by: \* Subreddits \* Score \* Date time \* Gilded \* Saved \* Mod Distinguished*

I have been given to believe that there is an addon for Chrome that lets you delete bulk comments, and that some of the third-party Reddit clients can do so too. I have not tried any of the above so cannot vouch for their effectiveness.

Finally, everyone deserves basic respect both online and in real life. Reddit is no exception. [https://www.antibullyingpro.com/dont-face-it-alone](https://www.antibullyingpro.com/dont-face-it-alone).

#Private Subreddits
::Features of Reddit::

It is rumoured that there are secret places in Reddit shrouded in intrigue, hidden from all but a select few. Subreddits only open to a certain elite. Subreddits cloaked in mystery and only spoken of by tantalising whispers in darkened rooms. Subs you don’t find but rather you are found by them and invited into when you least expect it. Is this true? Do such clandestine places exist, lurking in the shadows and hidden corners of Reddit’s bright and hallowed halls?

**Yes they do! Here’s a list!**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/wiki/privates](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/wiki/privates).

Ok, it isn’t up to date and not nearly complete, but it gives you some idea of what surprises you might find in your inbox one day.

* **How to get an invite**

Certain private subs have set rules that govern admittance, and getting invited to one usually depends on the reason it exists, perhaps because you have won particular Reddit awards or achieved a Reddit milestone. One such example is r/CentennialClub once you have 100k comment karma. There are also subs accessible only to Premium subscribers; [more information here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043034632-Premium-Only-Subreddits).

Bots roam Reddit to find and invite qualifying people to private subs. You might even be noticed from a larger sub to join one for a specific topic, or you might hear about one randomly. Clicking on a private subreddit will bring up a [page like this](https://i.redd.it/eeo9y32co1z81.jpg) (screenshot taken during the short while that sub went private in mid 2022) where you may get one or more of the options *Request to Join; Message Mods; Browse Reddit.*

To request access to a private subreddit you know the name of and think you qualify for, paste the following link into a browser which will send a message to all the moderators of the subreddit. Replace XYZ with the sub name:

[https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/XYZ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/XYZ)

If they approve your request, you will get a private message from them in your Inbox -> Messages with an invite link from any of the moderators of the private subreddit.

There’s an old but still relevant [discussion on ELI5](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2q04qk/eli5_why_are_some_subreddits_private_and_how_do/) that tells you a little more about private subs.

* **Things to know about private subs**

As you know, all the posts or comments you make on Reddit can be seen by anyone on your Profile History. However, any posts or comments you make in a private sub can only be seen by someone else if they are also a member of that same private sub. Private subreddits aren’t googleable either, nor are any contributions to them eligible for consideration in statistical analysis tools such as r/RedditMetis. You can crosspost into a private sub (if it allows crossposting) but you can’t crosspost out of one.

You should note that Reddit Admins can see inside of private subreddits regardless of whether they've been approved as users or not.

The main types of subreddits are [detailed here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060416112-What-are-public-restricted-private-and-premium-only-communities-), and whether you mod a sub or not, r/modguidehave a [very interesting post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modguide/comments/dt2qgr/private_restricted_or_public_subreddits/) on some of the differences between private, restricted, or public subreddits.

* **Sudden privacy**

The screenshot linked above showed a public subreddit that temporarily went private, and in the entry on [Brigading](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_brigading), I gave an example of a subreddit going private without any notice:

*…mods took* [*more drastic action*](https://mashable.com/article/antiwork-subreddit-fox-news-interview)*, temporarily closing their sub after* [*an interview didn’t go as planned*](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/sdesxw/megathread_rantiwork_goes_private_after_fox_news/)*.*

This is something that happens on Reddit from time to time for various reasons, and is usually only temporary. Recent incidents where many subreddits turned private to make a statement included a [protest against Covid misinformation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2021/08/30/dozens-of-subreddits-go-private-to-protest-reddits-covid-disinformation-policy/?sh=7136a36d1bbb) and shortly before that, a [protest against a controversial employee](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348255/reddit-moderator-blackout-protest-aimee-knight-uk-green-party).

This is not quite the same as the intentionally private subreddits, as in these instances, nobody except the moderating team (and admin) could see inside the subs; not even the regular members, and applications to join were not accepted.

* **There’s some weird stuff out there…**

There are some private subs with weird letter or number combinations for names that invite random people in from time to time. They don’t appear to have rules, or the ones they do have are so arcane they’re incomprehensible, as are their posts. Quite honestly, it’s really unsettling when you get an invite to one because they’re just *that* strange.

The reassuring news is that many of these remain from a long-forgotten April Fools event from some time ago but their bots still roam Reddit, waiting for that random trigger. Some of these subs are even still active - but with the only recent activity being from bewildered Redditors wondering where they are and why they’re there.

These legacy subs shouldn’t be confused with [subs you might find with names in the format *a:t5\_3akbn*](https://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/uu61lg/my_sub_name_changed_from_motogpchat_to_at5_3akbn/) as these are [dormant subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/o18ct9/creating_new_opportunities_for_future_community/) that have been removed.

There are also [places like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2q04qk/comment/cn1w50r/) which appear to defy anyone’s theories of what they are actually for.

#Profile
::Essentials for Newbies::

Your “home page” that everyone sees when they click on your username. Part of your “Settings” menu and at [https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile](https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile). Your profile is always public, though you can disable the option that shows subs you have recently been active in, and you can set your profile to NSFW. Your post and comment history, however, is there for all to see and cannot be hidden.

Posts to your profile can appear in r/all and your profile can be discovered in /users. Posting directly to your profile is optional. If you choose not to post to your profile you will not have a need for moderation tools, but those who might wish to use their profile page as a personal blog/subreddit are advised to look at the Profile Moderation Page link in Settings --> Profile.

There’s more detailed information on this here: [Profile Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_profile_page).

#Profile Page
::Essentials for Newbies::

All Redditors have a Profile Page linked to their username, and this basically works as a personal Subreddit where you can invite others to post or comment if you so wish. If you have Followers, posts to this page will come up on their home feed in the same way posts from any other sub they joined does. You can add links to certain other socials; indicate your Personal Gender Pronoun you might wish others to use; put a little bio of yourself or a favourite phrase or motto on it for everyone to see. You can also control your banner and avatar images, change your display name, and mark your profile as Not Safe for Work (NSFW).   If you’d rather not have your profile be easily discovered on Reddit, you can choose to hide your posts from r/all and /users. If you’d rather people not know what communities you’re most active in, you can choose to hide that information from your profile, but you should know they can still see posts and comments you make in public subreddits and private ones if they’re joined there too. In reality, people very rarely look at profiles of other Redditors.

* **What’s its purpose?**

Whatever you want it to be! Many Redditors don’t use it at all. The Redditor u/Shitty_Watercolour uses their Profile Page as a (fabulous) showcase; others may want to use it like a diary or blog; others might only use it as a place for uploading pictures to link to, or you might even use it for testing stuff - like practicing Markdown Text, for example - as you can post and delete to your heart’s content there. Redditors like the good folks at r/AwardBonanza will pin a post to their profile to collect the awards that they trade. The entry [Pinned Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_pinned_posts) will show you how to do this and the entry [award-cost-bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/2/#wiki_award-cost-bot) will tell you why. Only you will be able to submit content to your page. Out of interest, you might like to see Reddit’s [Media Guidelines](https://www.redditinc.com/assets/images/site/Reddit-Profiles_Best-Practices_Media-Hub.pdf)for profiles of companies or corporations.

* **Profile Moderation**

Those who might wish to use their profile page as a personal blog/subreddit are advised to look at the Profile Moderation Page link at the bottom of [https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile](https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile). You can access your profile moderation tools on the web by going to your profile, clicking Other Options, and selecting Profile Moderation.

Profile moderation tools are currently unavailable on mobile, but you can access them on a browser by going to this link: [https://www.reddit.com/user/me/about/edit/moderation](https://www.reddit.com/user/me/about/edit/moderation). If the link doesn’t work, substitute your own username for “me”. This will bring you to a page that [looks like this](https://i.redd.it/td4hdw0dav191.png). Just like a subreddit, the same [Mod Guidelines](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines-for-healthy-communities) and [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) applies to posts and conversations on your profile, so make sure you’re familiar with them before using your profile page.

You have a customisable profile, an avatar, a blog page, links to your socials…. so is Reddit a social media site or not?  [The debate is real](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/2j5dze/is_reddit_considered_social_media/).

#PSA
::Acronyms and Initials::

“Public Service Announcement”. In my younger and more vulnerable years, a Redditor gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since. So, here’s a llama PSA of some essential tips for safe early Redditing I wish I’d known about when I first joined:

* Always browse a subreddit first to get a feel of the place and read its [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) before participating in it, as they may have “forbidden” topics or strict formats to their content;
* Never comment on a post showcasing cool merchandise such as t-shirts, mugs, prints, stickers etc as it will invariably be a [spambot](https://www.reddit.com/r/FruitsBasket/comments/dcnuyv/psa_there_is_a_tshirt_scam_ring_active_on_reddit/) and you’ll be branded as an accomplice;
* Never post or comment anywhere offering Reddit Karma or upvotes in exchange for yours in return as these “karma farms” violate Reddit’s sitewide rule 2 and may get you a [Preemptive Ban](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_preemptive_ban) from an increasing number of subreddits.
* Always be sparing in your use of [Emojis](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_emojis) as some subreddits absolutely hate them.

* **Public Information Broadcasts**

You might like this parody of old-style newsreels on the history of [The Elegant Reddit Upvote](https://youtu.be/FHhnxJjJLRA).

For those of us in the U.K. of a “certain age”, [Public Information Broadcasts](https://www.bbc.co.uk/ideas/videos/the-public-information-films-well-never-forget/p06vh8tr) were a staple of our viewing, and are [often discussed](https://www.reddit.com/r/BritishTV/comments/dcafmv/public_information_films/) on some of the [subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/fgiuyn/uk_public_information_films_used_to_be_brutal/) about the [United Kingdom](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/65bj0e/the_best_ever_public_information_film_ever/), especially since the wonderful National Archives have made them all available [in one glorious collection](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/films/view_all_films.htm). Another superb collection of old newsreels [can be found here](https://www.britishpathe.com/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/pifsandpsas is for posting, viewing, and discussing public information films (PIFs) and public service announcements (PSAs), and r/PSA is for your Public Service Announcements.

#Psychology on Reddit
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Amateur psychological classification of different types of people is rampant on the Internet, and it’s almost a trope of its own to [dislike Redditors](https://www.quora.com/What-dont-some-people-like-about-Reddit). Type the words “Redditor Starter Pack” into your favourite image search engine and you’ll be faced with pages of images like [these](https://i.redd.it/jk7dkwan0f091.jpg). Sometimes, certain subreddits or groups of people can be [generally considered intolerable](https://www.businessinsider.com/10-types-of-reddit-users-people-hate-2013-7?r=US&IR=T) but of course Reddit isn’t all like that. In reality, *The Average Redditor*™ is a mythical being borne from our instinctive need to [classify people into archetypes](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-jungs-4-major-archetypes-2795439).

It's hard not to be sensitive to differences among the people around us. As a result, we’ve been trying to find a way to classify personalities ever since Hippocrates and the ancient Greeks proposed four basic temperaments (sanguine, choleric, melancholic and phlegmatic) and we’re still trying to find new [ways of doing so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_type) today. Reddit, as you would expect, has many Subreddits concerning the various methods of determining personality types.

* **Alignment**

Pop culture has its own methods of grouping people. In the “Dungeons & Dragons” (D&D) fantasy role-playing game, *alignment* is a categorisation of the ethical and moral perspective of player characters, non-player characters, and creatures. The co-creator, Gary Gygax, introduced the [two-axis alignment table](https://i.redd.it/eehbzp3obf091.jpg) as far back as 1978, with one scale being that from Good to Evil and the other being from Lawful (which emphasises “honour, trustworthiness, obedience to authority, and reliability”) to Chaotic (which emphasises “freedom, adaptability, and flexibility”). This then led to the development of a [basic alignment chart](https://i.redd.it/wjrefljocf091.png) which can be easily customised to categorise anything from [sandwiches](https://i.redd.it/5db143a014191.jpg) in the “Cube Rule of Food Identification” to [alignment charts themselves](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2251:_Alignment_Chart_Alignment_Chart).

Reddit, as you would expect, has embraced this concept wholeheartedly and the results can be seen at r/AlignmentCharts.

* **Carl Jung and Jungian Psychology**

Carl Gustav Jung (26 July 1875 – 6 June 1961) created many theories and ideas that are still used in psychology today, known as analytical psychology or Jungian Analysis. Jung spent his life learning from observation and read exceptionally widely on all manner of subjects, eventually creating the concepts of the collective unconscious, archetypes, extraversion (outer world) and introversion (internal world). ELI5 have a [short introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/udlgl/eli5_the_work_of_carl_jung/) to his complex work, and a [short animation](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ckps5n/the_modern_shaman_an_animated_guide_to_the/) on the r/philosophy Subreddit explores Jung’s two fundamental ideas: the collective unconscious and the stages of life.

A Subreddit devoted to this is r/Jung.

* **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)**

Katharine Briggs began her research into personality in 1917 as a means to understand what she saw as an unlikely attraction between her daughter, Isabel, and fiancé, Clarence Myers. Over 20 years, the mother-daughter team worked to develop the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, drawing heavily on the work of the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. Subreddits devoted to this include:

* r/MyersBriggs
* r/MbtiTypeMe
* r/mbtimemes
* r/genuineINTP

And [this Multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP+ESFJ+ESFP+ESTJ+INTP+ISTJ+enfj+entj+entp+estp+infj+infp+intj+isfj+isfp+istp+mbti/) contains 17 more communities related to the different MBTI types.

* **The Five-Factor Model**

Often called the “Big Five,” the five-factor model is a set of personality traits derived from a statistical study of words commonly used to describe psychological characteristics across cultures and languages. The categories are: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.

A Subreddit devoted to this is r/BigFive.

* **Objective Personality**

This is a system designed by Shannon and Dave Powers, that has been in function since 2014. They started by using Carl Jung’s 16 personality types, then, due to different behaviours shown by people with the same personality type, introduced a new typology called the Objective Personality System (OPS or OP) increasing these personality types from 16 to 512.

A Subreddit devoted to this is r/ObjectivePersonality.

* **Socionics**

Socionics is a theory of interpersonal interaction based on patterns of information selection and processing. Socionics has 16 types and 16 kinds of intertype relations. It even divides information itself into 8 varieties. The primary source of inspiration was, once again, Jung's Typology. However, Socionics developed in the 1970s and 80s in the former Soviet Union and was cut off from western psychology, including similar typological systems such as the MBTI. Today Socionics is popular in the Russian speaking world and is beginning to make inroads into other cultural realms.

A Subreddit devoted to this is r/Socionics.

* **Enneagram of Personality**

The Enneagram is a typology system that describes human personality as a number of interconnected personality types consisting of 3 centres of intelligence, [9 main Enneagram types](https://i.redd.it/jv2r2gzcl8191.jpg), 18 wings, 3 subtypes and triadic styles. Contemporary Enneagram theories are principally derived from the teachings of the Bolivian psycho-spiritual teacher Oscar Ichazo from the 1950s and the Chilean psychiatrist Claudio Naranjo from the 1970s. Naranjo's theories were also influenced by some earlier teachings about personality by George Gurdjieff and the Fourth Way tradition. Subreddits devoted to this include:

* r/Enneagram
* r/EnneagramType1
* r/EnneagramType2
* r/Enneagram3
* r/EnneagramType4
* r/Enneagram5
* r/enneagram6
* r/Enneagram8
* r/Enneagram9

And of course, because Reddit will Reddit, we also have r/enneagrammemes.

* **General Psychology Subreddits**

Reddit also has many places to discuss the broader aspects of typology and psychology both seriously and in more typical Reddit style, such as:

* r/psychology \- A community for sharing and discussing science-based psychological material.
* r/BadPsychology \- dedicated to pointing out the misunderstandings, and bad interpretations in the field of psychology.
* r/askpsychology \- not for mental health questions but a subreddit for questions about the mind and behaviour.
* r/psychologystudents \- a place for psychology students to discuss study methods, get homework help, job search advice etc.
* r/AcademicPsychology \- Where peer-reviewed psychology is shared and discussed.
* r/psychologymemes \- because memes have to be somewhere on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, right?
* r/psychomemeology \- who claim Sigmund Freud said "Meme is the gateway to unconscious".
* r/IOPsychology \- for all things Industrial Organizational Psychology.
* r/BehaviorAnalysis \- also see r/bcba and r/ABA for discussions on therapeutic evidence-based treatments.
* r/philosophy \- The portal for public philosophy.
* r/askphilosophy \- aims to provide serious, well-researched answers to philosophical questions.
* r/JungianTypology \- a community for the discussion of various typologies primarily related to, but not limited to, the works of Carl Jung. Topics include the Enneagram, MBTI, the Beebe Model, Socionics, Physiology, and Analytical Psychology.

Finally, here’s a more comprehensive [list of subreddits concerning psychology](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/wiki/psychology).

Many of the subreddits mentioned here will have links to other related subs in their sidebar or “About” tab. As always, it is important to check the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) before commenting or posting on an unfamiliar Subreddit.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

I would be remiss here in not mentioning r/psych \- a subreddit devoted to all things Psych: the TV show. If you do believe in *The Average Redditor*™, then r/averageredditor is the sub for you. For the “starter pack” meme we have r/starterpack and r/starterpacks. “Dungeons & Dragons” fans are well catered for at r/DungeonsAndDragons and r/DnD \- a subreddit dedicated to the various iterations of Dungeons & Dragons, from its First Edition roots to its Fifth Edition future. Other subs include r/dndnext, r/DMAcademy, r/DnDBehindTheScreen and, of course, r/dndmemes.

Finally, as I referred above to [The Cube Rule of Food Identification](https://cuberule.com/), I should mention r/toast, r/Sandwiches and r/eatsandwiches, r/tacos, r/sushi, r/calzone and r/hotdogs. Is a hotdog a sandwich? [The NewToReddit Mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/uqxx56/comment/i8tzbsh/) weigh in on the [perennial debate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2018/12/12/a-hot-dog-is-a-taco-a-steak-is-a-salad-a-pop-tart-is-a-calzone-let-the-cube-rule-explain/).

#Puns and Pop-Culture References
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

You won’t be on Reddit long before you start to notice that almost every conversation devolves into puns, jokes or long strings of pop-culture quotes or references. It can sometimes be quite irritating when a really fascinating discussion gets derailed by someone making a joke and then the rest of the thread devolves into everyone trying to out-joke each other, but Reddit is strange like that. You can’t beat it, so you might as well shrug your shoulders and join it.

In 2018, io9 put out a series on ['The 100 Most Important Pop Culture Moments of the Last 10 Years'](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-100-most-important-pop-culture-moments-of-the-last-1822241166) and many of the replies on these articles could be straight from Reddit.

Because puns are a way to make a super simple joke without needing to be creative, it’s a quick way to get a laugh and can always be easily understood. References are always welcome [because it's like being in on an inside joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/9ys1if/if_i_pack_my_comment_with_cultural_references/), and affirms you’re among your peers in liking the same movies or shows. Make that [Confirmation Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) work for you! Even better, you might get lucky and make that one comment in a pun thread that gets all the upvotes. If in doubt, pun. Always pun. Reddit loves puns.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/dadjokes acknowledges that some people are born with lame jokes in their heart and so here, everyone who has a cringe-worthy joke, verbal or visual pun that elicits a snort, face palm or groan is a dad.  r/puns claim to be the largest community of punsters on the Internet while r/pun don’t claim anything.  r/verypunny claim to have the best puns on Reddit while r/Jokesclaims to be the funniest sub on Reddit. We also have the r/PunPatrol, keeping Reddit safe from puns since 2018. If you see a pun, report it there.

#quityourbullshit
::Jargon and Slang::

A link posted when the OP clearly is not the originator of something they claim to be. Also known as QYBS. To post in r/quityourbullshit, you should have a screenshot or image of said bullshit successfully being called out. Even better with proof. Check the Pinned Posts before posting, because reposting something to r/quityourbullshit is the most bullshit thing you can possibly do.  r/quityourbullshit.

* **quityourbullshit calls out bullshit about quityourbullshit**

Bored Panda, a YouTube channel and blog, are [notorious for](https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/8i2gf3/this_bored_panda_post_stole_many_posts_from_this/) using posts from [Reddit as a source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/comments/afxzhj/bored_panda_is_at_it_again/) for their content, with scant credit or [even none at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/r19kkx/trash_clickbait_site_bored_panda_used_my_picture/) to the OP; sometimes with [serious consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/transtimelines/comments/6tv43a/psa_the_website_boredpanda_stole_images_from_here/).

In March 2021, r/quityourbullshit was forced to call out some bullshit involving itself when one of their mods revealed that someone on the Bored Panda blog team had gotten in contact with a view to writing [about them](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/m8a9lp/boredpanda_is_writing_about_qybs/).

The mod team’s response to the request was [legendary](https://i.imgur.com/cnsHb3j.jpg). So much so, that r/MurderedByWords not only lauded the post but stickied their own [post about it on their sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/m8f42t/mod_team_at_rquityourbullshit_spitting_fire/) which remained for some time.

It could only get better if it were then reported on Buzzfeed: "This website tried to reach out to this subreddit after stealing their content. You won't believe their response!". Sadly (or not), we’re still waiting for that level of meta.

Anyway, Bored Panda went ahead with the article, calling it [“56 Screenshots Of People Who Caught Others Shamelessly Spreading Lies On The Internet And Stepped In To Shut Them Up”](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319134020/https://www.boredpanda.com/quit-your-crap-people-called-out/?afterlogin=savecommentvote&comment=6440608&score=1) and crediting “The corner of the subreddit “Quit Your Bull”” as the source.

The “same” Bored Panda article as it appears today still gives “The corner of the subreddit “Quit Your Bull”” as the source but is now called [“30 Screenshots Of People Who Caught Others Shamelessly Spreading Lies On The Internet And Stepped In To Shut Them Up”](https://www.boredpanda.com/quit-your-crap-people-called-out/). Now I’m going to be absolutely honest here. I’m not *that* invested in the article to scour them both for differences. But this whole thing just reinforces what I say in my entry on [Content and Copyright](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_content_and_copyright): **…your Reddit story could well be monetised in some way by any random third party and you will rarely be asked for permission, acknowledged as the author or share in any profit.**

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

r/Spotatroll is a community for spotting the obvious trolls, the fiction writers, the backstory changers and the obvious fakes, r/MurderedByWords is a place for well-constructed put-downs, comebacks, and counter-arguments, while r/nukedfromorbit claims to have the best burns on Reddit.

#Quoting
::Essentials for Newbies::

Sometimes you might want to quote a line or a portion of the original post or even from someone else’s comment in reply to them. To differentiate that quote from your reply, you need to use a bit of Markdown Text. Don’t worry - it’s easier than it sounds.

In New Reddit you copy the text into the text box and use the " button (which might look like 99) to mark it as a quote. You can even highlight/select the part of the comment you're replying to and when you hit the reply button, it's already "quoted."

In Old Reddit or the markdown mode use > at the beginning instead.

On the mobile app, you select the three dots … drop-down menu below the comment to copy the entirety of the text and delete what’s inapplicable, then put the > symbol directly before the first word of your quote.  [https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting).

We have a new sister sub specifically to practice using Markdown such as this called r/LearnToReddit; a place to learn and practice using Reddit in regards to posting different post types, commenting, adding and editing flairs and so on, where the community will feedback on your post to let you know how you did, share tips, or help you get it right next time.
