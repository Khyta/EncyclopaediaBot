#T-Shirt Posts
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

If you see a post about a T-Shirt in any way, it probably isn‚Äôt what it seems to be, especially if the picture is captioned [‚ÄúIf you want this t-shirt, say yes in the Comments‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatSlaps/comments/noeft6/cat/) or similar. The likelihood of it being a Spambot is very, very high, especially when the immediate comments are asking where to buy it and another giving the link, as all three comments will be the same spambot using ‚Äúsock puppet‚Äù accounts to look like three different Redditors.

[Why you should not buy T-shirts/hoodies/mugs linked in comments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/httyd/comments/cl3el6/)

Do not engage with it; just use the Report option as Spam -> Link Farming, comment the subreddit link r/TheseFuckingAccounts and report the accounts to the admins at [https://www.reddit.com/report](https://www.reddit.com/report) and move on.

#‚ÄúTake my upvote and leave.‚Äù
::Jargon and Slang::

A phrase posted when you see something that makes you laugh and cry at the same time and you want to upvote it but don‚Äôt. But do. Normally across Reddit, mentioning upvotes is a dangerous game and you would quite rightly expect to be downvoted. However, one exception is the ‚ÄúReluctant Upvote‚Äù or the ‚ÄúAngry Upvote‚Äù. Use this phrase when you see a ridiculous post that is still good, like a really bad joke or overused meme that makes you groan but nevertheless works perfectly in ‚Äúthat‚Äù particular situation. Variants of this phrase include:

* Take my upvote and get the hell out of my house you filthy animal.
* Goddammit have an upvote.
* Take my upvote and get out.
* Here‚Äôs (or ‚ÄòHave‚Äô) my poor man‚Äôs goldü•á

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

When you are opposed to the idea of upvoting there‚Äôs r/Angryupvote for when you upvote something but are mad about it.

**See Also:**

* [Copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/3/#wiki_copypasta)
* ["I regret that I have but one upvote to give."](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/4/#wiki_.22i_regret_that_i_have_but_one_upvote_to_give..22)

#technicallythetruth
::Jargon and Slang::

A link or phrase posted when the information given is technically true, but far from the expected answer. Lies somewhere between (technically) the truth and ‚Äòdad‚Äô jokes. r/technicallythetruth.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

We also have r/technicallytrue, r/TechnicallyNotWrong and the more serious r/TechnicallyCorrect which is a subreddit for technical information in a video format.

#Tendies
::Jargon and Slang::

‚ÄúChicken Tenders‚Äù, which WSB uses as slang for profits on a trade. See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/glossary).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Find what you‚Äôre really looking for at r/FriedChicken, and here‚Äôs some recipes for home-made [Chicken Tenders](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/40n1dz/deep_fried_chicken_tenders/). Do you think that 200 chicken tenders for 200 people should be [enough food for a wedding party?](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingshaming/comments/nn1mgg/200_chicken_tenders_for_200_people_should_be/) Note that MOG here isn‚Äôt a scruffy cat, but means ‚ÄúMother Of the Groom‚Äù. Chicken keepers are also well catered for (no pun intended but still not sorry) on Reddit with r/BackYardChickens, r/chickens, r/BackyardChicken and r/poultry; and r/chickengifs is for, well, gifs of chickens.

#‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a Subreddit for everything‚Äù
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

A phrase posted to express amazement at finding an extremely obscure or weird sub. Have I told you yet that Reddit loves being meta? Post these links or phrases whenever you find something bizarrely fitting:

* r/surprisinglyasub \- For Subs that surprisingly exist, because why not?
* r/TheresARedditForThat \- To showcase, advertise or ask for specific subreddits.
* r/wowthissubexists \- For Subreddits you didn't think existed, but they do.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

To find those bizarrely fitting subs, here‚Äôs a [list of weird subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/comments/fi8rvg/list_of_weird_subreddits/) and a list of obscure subs at r/obscuresubreddits.

#theydidthemath
::Jargon and Slang::

A link posted when someone performs a useless but interesting calculation, such as [Aladdin & Jasmine‚Äôs magic carpet ride](https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/26q90q/aladdin_did_the_math/). The expected response to somebody posting r/theydidthemath is then to post r/theydidthemonstermath, which is a play on the 1962 Bobby Pickett novelty song ["The Monster Mash"](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vNuVifA7DSU), the chorus of which goes "They did the Mash!/They did the Monster Mash". At one time, this would then be followed by someone posting r/itwasagraveyardgraph before turning into a huge alternating Comment Chain with Bots and Fake Subreddits; not so much now. Reddit loves running jokes. Sometimes. r/theydidthemath.

#theyknew
::Jargon and Slang::

A link or phrase posted when innocent things appear to be anything but, though it's totally not intentional; or when you‚Äôre not quite sure whether an accidental double entendre or ‚Äú...ism‚Äù was deliberate or not. But you‚Äôre pretty sure it was. Often accompanied by a Lenny Face emoticon ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) They Knew.  r/theyknew.

Posting the single word ‚Äúthis‚Äù as a reply is an indication that you agree wholeheartedly with a comment and want to draw attention to it. Reddit preferred variants are This\^ or This. One-word comments are often heavily downvoted, so make sure you say something else as well, like ‚ÄúYes officer, this comment right here‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis is why I come to Reddit‚Äù.

#‚ÄúThis is the newest project of him?‚Äù
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

No, it absolutely isn‚Äôt. What it is, is a scam. ‚ÄúHim‚Äù in this case is hinting that it might be [Elon Musk](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/), who is Reddit‚Äôs darling. For some reason, this has unfortunately led to fake timepiece scammers posting this phrase all over Reddit.

u/ScamWatchReporter is a Redditor documenting and reporting such instances, and says: *‚Äú(The poster of) Airframe Black or Airframe Black Watch, Basedox black, Gripzip black, Midover black (the name changes once people catch on) is a SPAM account.

Elon Musk is actually a Redditor and can be found at u/ElonMuskOfficial.

#‚ÄùThis is the way‚Äù
::Lore and History::

An innocuous phrase that is not quite how it appears. Originating in the Disney+ Star Wars television series [The Mandalorian](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/the-mandalorian/), the phrase [is a mantra](https://youtu.be/uelA7KRLINA) used among the Mandalorian people. Reddit loves pop-culture references, and you will often find comment chains of [nothing but this saying](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/e1ydzl/white_house_on_lockdown_due_to_airspace_violation/f8sjad2/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) in the most unlikely places, and there is even a bot that counts the times a user has quoted it.

It is by no means the only catchphrase Reddit used in this way; a few years ago, Reddit embraced the show ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù where [It Is Known](https://youtu.be/72FkbGo78RQ) became the definitive end to any debate.

#TIAH
::Acronyms and Initials::

‚ÄúToday I Am Happy‚Äù. Originally sub specific from r/TodayIamHappy now with wider Reddit usage.

They would love to hear about what made you happy today.  r/TodayIamHappy.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Your Reddit experience is entirely what you make it.

#Time Magazine Person of the Year (2006)
::Lore and History::

This is an accolade you will occasionally see on Redditors‚Äô profiles. This is no idle boast; [it is absolutely true](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/times-person-of-the-year/table/?sort=year). That year, the magazine set out to recognize the millions of people who anonymously contribute user-generated content to wikis and other websites such as YouTube, MySpace, Facebook, Wikipedia, and the multitudes of other websites featuring user contribution.

They pronounced ‚ÄúYou were chosen in 2006 as Time magazine's Person of the Year‚Äù in their December 25, 2006 issue, with the cover featuring a reflective mirror surface. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You\_(Time\_Person\_of\_the\_Year)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(Time_Person_of_the_Year)). I would guess you can even claim the title yourself if you so wish, but I have no idea how it works if you were born after 2006.

#TL;DR:
::Acronyms and Initials::

‚ÄúToo Long, Didn't Read‚Äù. Often used as a sarcastic reply to a wall of text without paragraph breaks. Can be used in all capitals or as tl;dr: but never as a mixture. Good usage of this is when a Redditor puts TL;DR: after their long post followed by a one-line pr√©cis. Bad usage is when a Redditor uses it as a a reply to a post because they didn‚Äôt want to read it. Don‚Äôt be a bad Redditor.

#‚ÄúTo be fair...‚Äù
::Jargon and Slang::

An innocuous phrase that is not quite how it appears. This is another of Reddit‚Äôs beloved pop-culture references; [Letterkenny (NSFW: profanity)](https://youtu.be/BHyeGelTVCs). Whenever someone starts a post or comment with the phrase "to be fair", one of three things might happen:

Your post or comment might now be derailed with a Comment Chain, where your first reply will be slightly altered ("To be faaaiirrr..."), the next one even more (‚ÄúToooo beeee faaaiiiirrr...‚Äù) and so on ("To be faaaieeeh...") etc.

Or you might invoke a Copypasta. A favourite of Reddit here is a [Rick And Morty copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/6qhyr3/rick_and_morty/)documented at [Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/to-be-fair-you-have-to-have-a-very-high-iq-to-understand-rick-and-morty). To be fair, you have to have a *very* high IQ to understand Rick and Morty.

Then again, you might get lucky and your post or comment is taken at face value and your conversation goes as normal. Probably not but this is Reddit, to be fair.....

#TOMT
::Acronyms and Initials::

‚ÄúTip Of My Tongue‚Äù. When you can't remember that‚Ä¶thing‚Ä¶ ask other Redditors at r/tipofmytongue. You will see that the first reply to a post in that sub will usually be the OP replying with a comment to their own post simply saying "Comment" [or some variation](https://reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/ml93sj/tomt_song_title_we_cant_find_probably_metalrock/gtk1nq0). That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a rule on that subreddit that the OP must comment on their post after it goes up at least once, and points are only awarded to the correct answer if the OP replies again.  r/tipofmytongue.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

TOMT shouldn‚Äôt be confused with r/TheresANameForThat which tells you the names for all those things you know but didn‚Äôt realise they had a name or r/whatstheword for when there‚Äôs a word in your mind that you know but just cannot remember.

#Tone Indicators
::General Guides::

You will probably already know that placing /s at the end of your comment will clarify that you're being sarcastic, and /jk means you‚Äôre attempting to joke. These are Tone Indicators, and while they‚Äôve been around a very long time, you will gradually see more unfamiliar ones being used across Reddit.

A [Tone Indicator](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tone%20indicators) does exactly what it says it does: indicates the tone of what you're saying, and those are just two of many that are slowly becoming commonplace, especially among the [many neurodiverse Redditors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity) we have here.

    - An early problem  

From the moment that online quick communication was first devised, it soon became apparent that the written word alone wasn‚Äôt nearly enough to properly convey a meaning. Real conversation is full of paralinguistic information: the meaning that we glean from visual and vocal cues beyond the actual words spoken. We interpret what someone says from their voice; from tone, volume and pacing. We observe their facial expressions and their body language, and judge whether they sync with the spoken words. Electronic messages simply cannot compete.

    - An early solution 

[To try and get round this problem](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/sefSmiley.htm), Scott E. Fahlman, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, created the smiley face [in September 1982](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/Orig-Smiley.htm) and the rest is history. His solution: Add the symbol :-) to denote humorous posts, and add the symbol :-( to serious ones. In his announcement about this proposal, he had to advise readers to ‚Äúread it sideways.‚Äù

For some time, the generic term ‚Äòsmiley‚Äô was used to describe all kinds of these symbols that emerged, even angry ones. Another method of communicating intent originated in IRC channels in 1999 and was known as [Emotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emote). As the verb ‚Äòto emote‚Äô means to display emotions openly especially while acting, it made sense to use the same word to describe an entry in a text-based chat client that indicates an action taking place, but it didn‚Äôt seem to catch on in the same way as the later ‚Äòemoticon‚Äô or ‚Äòemoji‚Äô.

    - A current problem  

We have pretty much established that Reddit does not like modern emojis in preference of the Unicode text emoticon, but as the use of Tone Indicators is starting to catch on, a [comprehensive list of Tone Indicators](https://toneindicators.carrd.co/#masterlist) is available here. However, for the time being , be prepared to have to explain some of the more obscure ones like /neu or /lu.

#Trophies
::Features of Reddit::

Trophies are displayed on your profile and are awarded to you by Reddit for various tasks. You get a trophy when you verify your email and you also get a trophy that changes for every year you are on Reddit. Others aren‚Äôt as easy to obtain [and here‚Äôs a list of what‚Äôs currently available](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrophyWiki/comments/mdapdb/updated_trophy_list/). Their [previous list](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrophyWiki/wiki/obtainable_trophies) is useful too.

Trophies are different from Awards as they are not directly awarded by your fellow Redditors (except for Argentium Club and Ternion Club; Wearing Is Caring and to a certain extent, 100 Awards Club, but there‚Äôs a wait between getting the instant Award and the eventual Trophy while Reddit verifies them). [Here‚Äôs a list of older Trophies](https://www.reddit.com/trophies) and for more information, see r/RedditTrophies or r/TrophyWiki where the Esteemed Redditor u/Greenthund3r posts regular guides to old trophies.
