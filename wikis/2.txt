#Aardvarks
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::

Reddit loves animals. Reddit loves strangeness. Here, we have both! So why doesn’t r/aardvarks have more love? Find aardvarks, post them there. Please.

#About
::Essentials for Newbies::

The “About” tab on mobile contains essential information for the sub you are visiting. Also known as Sidebar on desktop. Always read the rules before commenting or posting on an unfamiliar Subreddit. These will be found in the Sidebar (on mobile this will be the About tab, Menu tab (where there is one) and Community Info found in the three dot “hamburger” post overflow menu top RH corner of your screen), any pinned posts (these will have a lime green ‘pin’ icon on the top corner and will show on top when you sort the Subreddit by ‘Hot’) and Wiki (where there is one). Here’s our [comprehensive guide to finding a subreddit’s rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/).

Some subs will have an F.A.Q. List, and many will have a Wiki. Unfortunately for mobile users, a subreddit Wiki is currently not compatible with the official Reddit app. Links given to any part of a Wiki will do one of three things to an app user:

1. Prompt one of the many “this subreddit does not exist” pop-ups.
2. Default to the very top of the wiki regardless of where on the page the link should send you.
3. [Mess up the format completely](https://i.redd.it/944m5oc3wli81.png).

However, opening the Wiki in a browser will work, though not an ideal solution.

#Absolute Unit
::Memes and Trends::

It's as large as life and twice as natural! If it’s big, it can be described as a unit. If it’s really big, it’s an absolute unit. Unless it’s a cat, [in which case it’s a chonk](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/chonk-oh-lawd-he-comin).

Memes, just like every other joke format, don’t exist in a vacuum, which is why being aware of their origins is crucial. While we are happy to use phrases like this as an affectionate way to refer to a large, round animal or object, its origin is far less innocent, being an image of a [large man standing behind the Queen Of England](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/absolute-unit), with the caption, “In awe at the size of this lad. Absolute unit.” Despite having the picture on their heading, [r/AbsoluteUnits](https://www.reddit.com/r/AbsoluteUnits/) are looking for animals mostly, particularly cute animals which happen to be very large. Only public figures are allowed; no harassment, creep-shots, witch-hunts or fat-shaming is allowed.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[r/TinyUnits](https://www.reddit.com/r/TinyUnits/) is a chilled out place for sharing videos, gifs, and images of tiny animals, insects & random objects you find pretty awesome!

#Accidental Alt
::Features of Reddit::

It is possible to have an accidental account on Reddit! This comes as a shock to many people when they discover they’ve inadvertently created a different account by clicking "sign in with Google/Apple". Doing that creates a new, or alternate account (Alt) with a random username, usually consisting of [two unrelated words joined with an underscore or hyphen, followed by a random number](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/n75l53/my_icon_info/).

These automatically generated usernames can be changed within 30 days of account creation by going to your profile where a prompt should appear asking if you would like to keep or change the username. If the prompt does not show up, you may have accidentally chosen to keep the username and you would have to create a new account in order to have another username.

Creating an Alt can happen easily by accident, especially if you're logged in with Chrome, or sometimes on iOS mobile by following a generic link like: [https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile](https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile). To get back to a normal account, stop using the "sign in with Google/Apple ID" option and instead type out your usual username and password combinations.

#accidentalswastika  
::Memes and Trends::

A link posted when you find an unintentional swastika shape in logos and designs of all kinds. Before posting there, please check the Forbidden Post List at [https://old.reddit.com/r/accidentalswastika/](https://old.reddit.com/r/accidentalswastika/) first, because some Swastikas aren’t unintentional or even malicious. *Sauwastika* are ancient religious symbols used as 卐 by Hindu/Jain (among others) and as 卍 by Buddhists (among others), and until recently, the [“Hakaristi”](http://www.strangehistory.net/2015/02/24/good-swastikas-hakaristi/) was a symbol used by [Finland’s Air Force](https://www.dw.com/en/finlands-air-force-removes-the-swastika-from-logo-after-almost-a-century/a-54020470). Indeed, the swastika shape has a [fascinating history worldwide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika); Context, as always, is everything. [r/accidentalswastika](https://www.reddit.com/r/accidentalswastika/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[r/hailhortler](https://www.reddit.com/r/hailhortler/) is for deliberate attempts at drawing Nazi Swastikas, i.e. the “Hakenkreuz” (hook-cross), that have failed somewhat, and [r/beholdthemasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/beholdthemasterrace/) mocks supremacy according to their sidebar criteria.

#Account Hacked?  
::Essentials for Newbies::

If you suspect your Reddit account to have been hacked, you can view the activity on your account and log out any sessions you don’t recognise here: [https://www.reddit.com/account-activity](https://www.reddit.com/account-activity).

If you believe your account to have been hacked, [here are Reddit’s guidelines](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045768792-I-need-help-with-a-hacked-or-compromised-account) on what to do.

#Achievements  
::Features of Reddit::

On some subreddits, you might notice you have [mystery awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/t2z8xm/what_is_this_award_for/) which add a little sprite next to your username, which, once clicked reveal titles such as "Avid Voter" or "Prolific Commenter".

These aren’t [Awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/2/#wiki_awards) or even [Trophies](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/8/#wiki_trophies) in the traditional Reddit sense, but are actually [Achievements](https://i.redd.it/1p0sqrimwwr81.jpg) automatically conferred on anyone who contributes to a powered-up community. See: [Powerups](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_powerups).

There are two types of achievements; [the first](https://i.redd.it/3cyg5erh9xr81.jpg) are given to anyone posting or commenting in a powered up community, and [the second](https://i.redd.it/2rikg1iw9xr81.jpg) are for those who do the powering-up for that community. You can see yours by either clicking on the icons next to your username or by viewing your profile (on mobile; I don’t know if it works on desktop) while you’re in that community.

You won’t see these achievements outside the powered-up subreddit either next to your username or on your profile. If the subreddit loses its powerups, your achievements will also disappear.

There is one acronym you should always [report immediately](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/qyxjyk/how_to_report/) if you see it being used and that is KYS. Originating in gaming communities, this is shorthand for “kill your self \[sic\]” as an “edgy” way to say “fuck you”. However, Reddit believes that suicide is a very serious subject and this kind of language should not be taken lightly. Inviting someone to commit suicide is against our code of conduct and may well incur a ban.

#Activity  
::Essentials for Newbies::

Part of your Inbox (the envelope icon), and also known as Notifications, this lists recent replies to any of your posts or comments. Also refers to your Reddit Account Activity, which you can check at [https://www.reddit.com/account-activity](https://www.reddit.com/account-activity).

You might not know that Reddit shows other users if you are currently active or not. Here is how to hide yourself [on mobile](https://i.redd.it/rsa2mt5nluk61.gif) and here’s how to hide yourself [on desktop](https://i.redd.it/8hggkgtnluk61.gif).

A question I’m often asked is “Can others see my reddit activity such as upvoted / downvoted posts, saved posts or followed subreddits?” The good news is that nobody (mods or other redditors) can see what you upvoted, downvoted, saved or unsaved, neither can they see the subs you have visited, joined or left.

I'm unaware of any way that people can tell you've visited a sub if you've never posted/commented in it. However, Reddit will show which subs you're active in. I don't know what the criteria are to be considered "active," but I'm guessing you have to have posted or commented in it at least once or twice. You have options in your privacy settings that can limit some of this information from being given out [under Preferences --> Privacy Options](https://i.redd.it/eibwgjlus2s61.jpg) or go to User Settings --> Profile --> Active in communities visibility --> Disable. In Old Reddit, the setting is here: [https://old.reddit.com/prefs/](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/)

If you're anxious about what others can see on your account, you're welcome to create a throwaway ‘Alt’ account. You can use that account to visit subs that you might not want to show up in your original account. It is not linked to your original account and it's as anonymous as you want it to be. Multiple accounts are allowed as long as they don't engage in vote manipulation or ban evasion from a sub.

#Admin
::Essentials for Newbies::

Administrator: employees paid by Reddit who control the website and apps. Reddit as a whole is run by unpaid volunteers called Moderators (mods) and paid employees called Administrators (admin), and Admin basically let mods run their subs however they like so long as they abide by the TOU.

Admin are the highest authority on Reddit. They can do everything a mod can do and more, including suspending accounts, all on a sitewide scale. They are generally not interested in anything that goes on in any specific subreddit as their concern is for Reddit as a whole. They can be appealed to by both mods to ban users (with evidence the user is breaking the TOU) and users to rescind Spam Filter shadowbans. Admin are rarely seen but are very distinctive as they have the word ADMIN in bright red next to their username, or on some platforms a red username with a little Red Snoo icon next to it.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[r/ideasfortheadmins](https://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/) is a subreddit where you can submit ideas from your Reddit feature wishlist for admin consideration. However, it is not an admin-run community, so they can't personally implement the ideas.

#Adopting a Subreddit  
::General Guides::

You might occasionally come across a Subreddit that hasn’t been active in a long time. Dead or abandoned subreddits exist for a number of reasons, mostly due to the inactivity of its moderators. If you would like to adopt and revitalise one for yourself, see the instructions at “Creating a Subreddit”. We have many experienced sub creators, adopters and moderators at [r/NewToReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/) who would be very happy to help you set this up and promote it, etc.

#Advertising and Self-Promotion  
::General Guides:: 

Reddit is a community, not a platform for self-promotion. Our rules don’t say you can't share your stuff here, but there are some ‘do’s and don’ts’ to make sure it doesn’t work against you. The [Reddit guide to self-promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion?) is essential reading if you wish to use Reddit as a platform for marketing your stuff, whether it be a YouTube channel, Etsy account, Only Fans or whatever. You also absolutely need to read the rules of an individual subreddit before posting in any kind of promotional way so as to not get banned.

Redditors don’t tend to like adverts and are naturally suspicious of anyone they think might turn on “the hard sell”. Our promotional guidelines basically boil down to "its okay to use your account to promote, just don't be an account for a promotion". As a general rule of thumb, engage with the wider Reddit community by commenting and submitting things that aren't just related to promoting your stuff, and just generally be a part of the whole Reddit discussion.

Try to have a 1 in 10 approach to Reddit; as in only one out of ten posts and comments should be promotional. If someone is suspicious of your motives and looks at your profile and finds all your engagement here is promotional, people are just going to see you as spammy, or even worse: a shill. There will be useful subreddits dedicated to helping you with your particular area of interest, such as [r/youtubers](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/), [r/EtsySellers](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/) or [r/onlyfansadvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/onlyfansadvice/) and their Sidebars may also contain lists of other helpful subs.

For actual or corporate advertising on Reddit see [https://www.redditinc.com/advertising](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising), the subreddit [r/redditads](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditads/) and also [https://ads.reddit.com](https://ads.reddit.com/). A good place to start is the Reddit [advertising policy overview](https://advertising.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-advertising-policy/reddit-advertising-policy-overview).

Please read [the official rules on using Reddit as a marketplace](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513471). When considering a gift or transaction of goods or services not prohibited by this policy, keep in mind that Reddit is not intended to be used as a marketplace and takes no responsibility for any transactions individual users might decide to undertake in spite of this. Always remember: you are dealing with [strangers on the internet.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*Wv5rHUzi5-61HcCw.jpg)

#Adverts  
::Features of Reddit:: 

Like any big online presence, Reddit needs to earn revenue to pay for server costs etc, and Reddit is no exception. Advertisers have a [set of guidelines they must follow](https://advertising.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-advertising-policy/reddit-advertising-policy-restricted-advertisements) and there are a growing number of [online guides](https://www.shivarweb.com/3100/how-to-advertise-on-reddit/) available to encourage new corporate style advertising here.

You can’t turn adverts off without having Reddit Premium or using an ad-blocker or third-party Reddit apps such as Apollo or Reddit Enhancement Suite, but there is a way you can tailor those ads to your preference by [adjusting your ads personalisation settings](https://i.redd.it/j2edhuo42yg41.png) in your user profile. That should hopefully change the specific advertising that you see on Reddit. I know at one time we had the option to press a little X on the ad itself to let us hide a specific advert/advertiser but I’m not sure if that still exists or not. There may be more info at [r/redditads](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditads/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

See strange and amusing adverts at [r/FunnyCommercials](https://www.reddit.com/r/FunnyCommercials/), cool and clever ones at [r/AdPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdPorn/), lovely old ones at [r/vintageads](https://www.reddit.com/r/vintageads/), and [r/Adgeek](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adgeek/) brings you the best that the ad world has to offer - and occasionally the worst. Share the loathing at [r/CommercialsIHate](https://www.reddit.com/r/CommercialsIHate/), and if you find a cringey advert while scrolling through Instagram or stumble upon a promoted tweet that’s just a bit *too* outside the realm of normality (you know which ones I mean), share the burden at [r/CursedAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/CursedAds/). Finally, adverts can take on a whole new dimension when they’re placed next to something they really shouldn’t be, and you can see this at [r/unfortunateplacement](https://www.reddit.com/r/unfortunateplacement/).

#Advice Subreddits  
::General Guides::

Reddit has a plethora of Subreddits where you can crowdsource serious advice on family, relationship, legal, medical, financial or other issues, and you will find a starter list of these subreddits at “[Relationship and Advice Subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/6/#wiki_relationship_and_advice_subreddits)”.

Subs of this nature are [tightly controlled](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/10/reddit-moderation-relationships-subreddit-memes/600322/), but even so, some outcomes can go [terribly, terribly wrong](https://rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5eez5c/update_lessons_and_how_you_can_help_re_the_case/). Sometimes, well-meaning Redditors will fall for scammers with [real-world consequences ensuing](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hj2bpg/user_in_rama_takes_the_piss_with_a_fake_cancer/).

Like everything, you should approach advice subreddits with a balance of healthy scepticism and sincerity - with one clear exception: begging for money. If someone posts, comments or sends you a direct message or chat request asking for money of any amount for any reason, please [report the post](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058309512-How-do-I-report-a-post-or-comment-) or if it was a DM, [report it here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058752951-How-do-I-report-a-private-message-), refer them to [r/assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/assistance/), block them and move on. If they are genuine, [r/assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/assistance/) has the experience and a [useful resource of Subreddits that may be able to help them](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1hexgp/other_subreddits_that_can_help_you/) in a controlled way.

#AFAIK  
::Acronyms and Initials::

“As Far As I Know”. AFAIK this “small dictionary project” might take me years and still never be finished. However, I’ll keep on, with unabated perseverance, and the hill has not yet lifted its face to heaven that perseverance will not gain the summit of at last.

---

#AITA  
::Acronyms and Initials::  

“Am I the Asshole?”. Originally sub specific from [r/AmITheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAsshole/) now with wider Reddit usage. This subreddit aims to be a catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in an argument that's been bothering you. Tell them about any non-violent conflict you have experienced with both sides of the story, ask WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) and see if YWBTA (You Would Be The Asshole); or if you're in the right (NTA or “Not The Asshole”), if everyone is right (NAH or “No Assholes Here”), everyone is wrong (ESH or “Everyone Sucks Here”) or if it’s absolutely certain that You're The Asshole (YTA). [r/AmITheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAsshole/).

As with all subs, it’s important to read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnToReddit/comments/pjsazs/finding_a_subreddits_rules/) before participating, but you should note that AITA has a 3,000 character limit on their Posts (including the title) and it is probably a good idea to test your Post first at [https://www.lettercount.com/](https://www.lettercount.com/)

Stories from this sub often get [picked up by other media](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/16217943/banned-daughters-birthday-party-mums-fuming/) so be very careful about not including any identifiable details in your submission.

Be warned that activity in this subreddit can earn you [a pre-emptive ban](https://i.redd.it/44f4kl0ooy281.jpg) from other subreddits that have AITA on their blacklist.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[r/AmITheAngel](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAngel/) is a place to satirise AITA posts where OP obviously did nothing wrong and is just looking for validation, and [r/AmITheDevil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheDevil/) is a place to satirise AITA posts where it's obvious OP is the asshole.

#Alder’s Razor aka Newton's Flaming Laser Sword  
::Tropes and Oneupmanship::  

Newton's Flaming Laser Sword is a saying commonly known as an “Eponymous Law”, but more accurately as a [Philosophical Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor) that reads [”If something cannot be settled by experiment, it is not worth debating.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Alder#Newton's_flaming_laser_sword).

Applied broadly, this particular principle suggests that you should generally only focus on problems that can be solved by a combination of experimentation and reasoning, and not just argumentation, and if it’s possible to perform an experiment to settle a matter you should. This will save you from wasting a lot of time on (currently) unanswerable questions and allow you to make progress faster. For example; engaging in untestable speculation is a waste of time when there’s a simpler solution:

* Which horse is faster? Race them.
* How many teeth does your dog have? Count them.
* Which MMA fighter is better? Make them fight.
* **It’s called what now?**

Mike Alder was not shy of [revealing the reasoning](https://philosophynow.org/issues/46/Newtons_Flaming_Laser_Sword) behind this unusual title:

*“All good principles should have sexy names, so I shall call this one Newton’s Laser Sword on the grounds that it is much sharper and more dangerous than Occam’s Razor. In its weakest form it says that we should not dispute propositions unless they can be shown by precise logic and/or mathematics to have observable consequences. In its strongest form it demands a list of observable consequences and a formal demonstration that they are indeed consequences of the proposition claimed. Those philosophers who followed Newton became known as ‘scientists’ and eventually Karl Popper came along and codified the practice of these heretics in his famous falsifiability demarcation criterion.”*

Just as spectacularly, the opposite of Alder’s Razor is called “Alder's Duct Tape”. Also known as Alder's Krazy Glue or Alder's Stapler, or even “Newton's Arc Welder”, this is pretty much the exact opposite of Newton's Flaming Laser Sword - “Let’s not expose the debate so experiments will be unnecessary or useless, or conversely let’s debate the newest documented experiments just to suggest more experiments.” This is only used ironically.

While a philosophical razor can be a useful mental shortcut that allows you to make decisions and solve problems quickly and easily, it is not an unbreakable law or rule, and Newton’s Flaming Laser Sword excludes a lot of things (anthropology, history, politics, ethics etc.) and should therefore be used very cautiously. Not everything is observable, measurable, repeatable, testable etc. so as to be fit for the scientific method.

* **Newton's Flaming Laser Sword on Reddit**

Reddit, as you would expect, takes Newton's Flaming Laser Sword [Very Seriously Indeed™](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2v44kk/til_newtons_flaming_laser_sword_is_a/) and it has been the [subject of debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/aqyu45/what_do_philosophers_think_of_newtons_flaming/) in many [different subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/12ec45/to_all_where_do_you_stand_on_newtons_flaming/).

#Alt  
::General Guides::  

Alternative user account. You are allowed to have more than one Reddit account and are almost encouraged to if it’s necessary for privacy. This is a Reddit Admin’s [comment on multiple accounts](https://reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/3dvzyh/request_force_verified_accounts_ban_based_on/ct9xax1/), and some people have an Alt to frequent Subreddits they might not want associated with their better known username.

Your Main and your Alt act as entirely separate accounts, even if you use the same email. You might have infinite Karma, premium, and access to private subreddits on one account but none of these will carry over to the other. For instance, I have an Alt account that I use to role play as a total newbie to test subreddits to see if they are newbie friendly. My main account ([u/llamageddon01](https://www.reddit.com/u/llamageddon01/)) is premium with lots of karma and trophies. My Alt isn’t, so I get the full vanilla Reddit experience with ads, post and comment removals, no access to the super-secret premium subreddit, the works.

*The Average Redditor*™ - including mods - can only see posts and comments you make on the specific profile they are looking at, so unless you actually specify somewhere that you have an Alt and reveal its username, they will never be able to connect the two, even if they use the same email address.

A warning here: Admins See All, so be careful how you use your Alt. Reddit knows. Reddit always knows.

Reddit does not tolerate users that upvote or award their own posts using an Alt, as spammers are constantly trying to implement upvote schemes with alts to get their content to the top of the big subreddits. This is called [Vote Manipulation](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043066412-What-constitutes-vote-cheating-or-vote-manipulation-) and is one of the few things that can incur a sitewide ban on Reddit. Likewise, making an Alt for the specific purpose of circumventing a subreddit ban on Reddit isn’t allowed. This is called [Ban Evasion](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043504811-What-is-Ban-Evasion-) and is also grounds for a sitewide permaban from the whole of Reddit with no recourse.

If you do have an Alt (or Alts) the safest thing is to ensure they never even post or comment on the same subreddits to avoid any accidental mistakes. You might find using Custom Feeds useful to separate out your Alt account use.

#AMA  
::Acronyms and Initials::  

“Ask Me Anything”. Originally sub specific from [r/AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/) now with wider Reddit usage. Not to be confused with [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) which is occasionally frequented by guest VIPs from all walks of life such as actors, authors, celebrities or other famous or notable persons wanting feedback or interaction on their latest projects. [r/AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/).

#”And My Axe!”  
::Memes and Trends::  

This is another one of Reddit’s beloved pop-culture references, this time from the movie “Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring”. In the film, the characters Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli agree to assist the hobbits Frodo and Sam in their quest to deliver the Ring of Power to Mount Doom in order to destroy it. The characters offer their weapons in turn, [pledging their allegiance](https://youtu.be/mmQyAR4EYJU).

The format can be used as an expandable Snowclone format “You Have My *X*, and My *Y*, and My *Z*.” and is sometimes used as a bait-and-switch punchline to derail a conversation into a Comment Chain in which consecutive replies start with "And My *X*.". You can see this used to good effect in the comments under [this explanation of what the phrase means](https://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/docze/i_give_up_what_does_and_my_axe_mean/). Reddit loves being meta.

The [Urban Dictionary suggests](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=and%20my%20axe%21) you could actually tack this onto the end of any sentence that ends in a noun. I’ll let you be the judge as to the wisdom of that.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[r/unexpectedgimli](https://www.reddit.com/r/unexpectedgimli/) documents the times this reference is found in posts or comments where it wouldn’t normally be expected, [r/lotrmemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/) claim to have the finest memes in the Southfarling, while [r/AndMyAxe](https://www.reddit.com/r/AndMyAxe/) is dormant, and might even be available for request.

#Animals: Faked Photography  
::Culture and Etiquette::  

There’s not much on Reddit that gains the upvotes more than a cute animal photo - until Redditors [discover there’s a grim truth behind it](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/9oh2kd/what_a_great_story/).

Whimsical ‘nature’ stills photography is easy to fake and isn’t actually against some photo competition rules [as this article states](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3994285): “Images used in Nature Photography competitions may be divided in two classes: Nature and Wildlife. Images entered in Nature sections meeting the Nature Photography Definition above can have landscapes, geologic formations, weather phenomena, and extant organisms as the primary subject matter. *This includes images taken with the subjects in controlled conditions, such as zoos, game farms, botanical gardens, aquariums and any enclosure where the subjects are totally dependent on man for food*.”

* **They do what now?**

This all sounds quite benign, until the next time you see an underwater photo of a kingfisher catching its lunch. Look closely at the fish; it might not be alive at all, or even worse, [its tail might have been removed](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeAmazed/comments/e4hi0z/a_kingfisher_catching_a_fish_underwater/) to prevent it swimming away in the studio aquarium or tank setup.

Fishing wire and glue shouldn’t form part of a nature photography kit, but some photographers rely on them for their cute-but-cruel portfolios. One photographer is notorious for [posing frogs with snails](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/87t9ka/a_frog_wearing_snails_as_headphones/) and some make [no secret of manipulating the creatures without Photoshop](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/compound-eye/a-fake-makes-it-to-the-smithsonians-photo-contest-finalists/) at all.

That cute frog [riding a tortoise](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/whimsical-wildlife-photography-isnt-seems) also isn’t what it seems, neither is the photo of a [laid-back lizard playing the guitar](http://antiviral.gawker.com/forward-or-delete-this-weeks-fake-viral-photos-1689864735) or the one of a [tree frog riding a beetle](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/5t8qcn/just_a_tiny_frog_riding_a_tiny_beetle/) that resurfaces on [r/aww](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/) or [r/pics](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/) from time to time. [This article claims it’s authentic](http://resourcemagonline.com/2015/02/photographer-snaps-a-frog-horsing-with-a-beetle/48438/) but as the photographer is being interviewed by the Daily Mail, more than a little scepticism is warranted.

It doesn’t take much of a search to find that article is [very much in the minority on that opinion](https://gizmodo.com/can-this-picture-of-a-frog-riding-a-beetle-be-real-or-i-1689732899) and that there’s strong evidence posted by the photographer himself that the [frogs and many of his subjects were captive animals](https://petapixel.com/2015/03/05/a-frog-riding-a-beetle-is-this-a-real-wildlife-photo-or-a-bunch-of-bs/). An herpetologist in that article said “I can’t stand these images. To someone very familiar with frogs, it’s really sad to see the poor frog in this situation. I don’t believe that these photos are of a naturally occurring situation. To me, they appear to be highly staged, and there is evidence that the frog is distressed. Frogs are so amazing without being used as props, it’s upsetting that they felt it necessary.”

The overriding problem is that most of these kinds of cute-but-cruel photos originate from countries where exotic creatures live without many of the animal rights protections [they really need to have](https://gizmodo.com/those-adorable-animal-pics-may-be-fake-and-cruel-1173395567).

Some years ago, [*The Verge* ran an article](https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2016/8/25/12645074/fake-nature-photography-facebook-viral-animal-photos) highlighting the work a Facebook group is doing to call out these and similarly cruelly staged photos, and on Reddit, [r/photography](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/) isn’t shy of talking about [the ugly side of wildlife photography](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/4efnpv/the_ugly_side_of_wildlife_photography/).

* **The good news**

Not every photo is staged. Some wildlife photographers [spend years trying to get that perfect shot](https://www.wired.com/2016/01/alan-mcfadyen-kingfisher-dive/) and some just get very lucky indeed. The famous shot of a [weasel hitching a ride on the back of a woodpecker](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31711446) comes with plenty of authentication as the photographer posted photos of the entire sequence including the weasel running away and the exhausted bird recovering [after the landing](https://www.ripleys.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WeaselPecker01.jpg). Some photos are staged but without any cruelty involved. [The little owl in the rain sheltering underneath a mushroom](https://www.boredpanda.com/owl-hiding-from-rain-mushroom-podli-tanja-brandt/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic) is a great example.

So how can you call them out without becoming bitter and cynical about everything you see? Your favourite search engine is your friend here. Use a reverse image search or [u/risbot](https://www.reddit.com/u/risbot/) to check that cute photo before commenting. Call out staged photos whenever you see them, and maybe also on [r/AnimalRights](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalRights/), [r/quityourbullshit](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/) or [r/untrustworthypoptarts](https://www.reddit.com/r/untrustworthypoptarts/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

If you want to see animals in odd poses without any cruelty involved, [r/birdswitharms](https://www.reddit.com/r/birdswitharms/) and [r/HybridAnimals](https://www.reddit.com/r/HybridAnimals/) are great places to start, and [r/TieremitSesselohren](https://www.reddit.com/r/TieremitSesselohren/) is a classic sub of animals with chairs as ears. I am honestly surprised by how small their community still is.

#Animals: Faked Videos  
::Culture and Etiquette::  

YouTube, ViralHog, TikTok and similar pop media outlets are rich pickings for Redditors looking for new content to post, especially when it comes to short animal videos. Unfortunately, some of these cute rescue videos which look fun, fascinating and excellent fits for subreddits like [r/humansbeingbros](https://www.reddit.com/r/humansbeingbros/), [r/nextfuckinglevel](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/), [r/BeAmazed](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeAmazed/), [r/Damnthatsinteresting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/) or even [r/blackmagicfuckery](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmagicfuckery/), are [likely to have been staged](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/animals-youtube-facebook-tiktok-video-b1906254.html).

Quite apart from any ethical issues (of which there are obviously many), posting one of these on Reddit can backfire on you when someone inevitably comes along to debunk them. The upvotes and accolades you were hoping to get become downvotes and flame. So, how can you spot these fakes before posting one?

* **What went on before the video started?**

When a short video throws you straight into the action, you’re so caught up in the narrative that you don’t consider what might have happened immediately before. For instance, that cute little hermit crab scurrying across a beach [choosing between various shells](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/772d3m/helping_homeless_hermit_crab_find_a_new_shell/) thoughtfully provided by the person in the film?

What we don’t know is how the unfortunate crustacean became homeless on a hot beach in the first place when they normally go house-hunting underwater; how the person so conveniently found the homeless critter at the very time he decided to switch-up shells, and where they got all those semi-identical perfect shells the person presents to the helpless animal on an otherwise empty beach. Talking of which, just how did [that octopus find itself stuffed into an ill-fitting shell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/n02yh4/i_dont_think_octopi_stuff_themselves_in_conch/)?

Nobody wants to think the worst of people. We shouldn’t be forced into a position where we start to think every lovely coincidence has an alternative and grim backstory. But unfortunately, [there is a very real problem with animal videos we need to be aware of](https://www.reddit.com/r/rage/comments/iy4ey6/the_disturbing_fake_animal_rescue_channels/). Puppies and kittens in immediate and unlikely peril? [There’s quite a lot of them](https://inspiremari.nl/watch-out-for-fake-animal-rescue-videos-on-youtube/), unfortunately, including [staged “snake rescue”](https://gizmodo.com/youtube-starts-banning-fake-rescue-videos-of-snakes-att-1835376766) videos and the problem is that many of these channels are based in countries where there are little or no animal rights protections so they’re not going to go away soon.

* **Staged fishing videos**

Another type of staged video shows people [fishing with coke and mentos (or similar unlikely items)](https://youtu.be/tSI-kj9A_pc). They have [all been exposed as fakes](https://www.sciencealert.com/is-that-viral-catfish-egg-coke-and-mentos-video-a-hoax). Again, it’s what we don’t see that is the problem: to the left of the hole (off camera) is another person just shoving pre-caught fish (or whatever the video is demonstrating) through these holes.

One video uploaded by the originator of these videos claims the videos are planned, scripted, and made for fun, and gave a disclaimer that no animals are hurt and the fish “come out by pushing behind the video at the left side.” However, it is pretty clear in iDubbbz’s video that some of those catfish have been out of water for some time, and that snake who was pretty reluctant to go into the water suddenly can’t get in quick enough when it apparently reaches air again at the other end of the hole that is hidden from us.

* **Fake in other ways**

This heartwarming video of a [stranded newborn turtle being rescued](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/s307dr/a_stranded_newborn_turtle_was_rescued/hsi9dno/) may not be exactly what it seems to be, as the staging appears to be part of a trend of beach hotels cashing in on [baby turtle release programs](https://www.diveagainstdebris.org/action/help-release-baby-turtles-ocean) and offering them to their guests [as an activity](https://www.minorhotels.com/en/media/press-releases/anantara-resorts-in-thailand-gives-nature-a-helping-hand-with-baby-turtle-release).

While environmentally responsible tourism can bring benefits both to the natural world and the commercial, there will also be those who try to [disguise pure exploitation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/tfsthl/absolute_beauty/i0yi1sd/) as sanctuary or conservation efforts. That seemingly lovely video is apparently from [a roadside zoo](https://www.roadsidezoonews.org/post/single-vision-cited-by-feds-again-8-animals-dead-since-last-inspection) which operates under less than [satisfactory conditions](https://911animalabuse.com/single-vision/).

* **Reddit to the rescue?**

Reddit, on the whole, is doing a good job in [exposing fake animal rescue rings](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/lv77kv/youtubes_fake_animal_rescue_ring/) and the subreddit [r/AnimalRights](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalRights/) keeps a list [for reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalRights/comments/jtsglp/please_report_these_fake_animal_rescue_channels/).

One recent notable event saw some Reddit users [stop an alleged animal cruelty case](https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/norwegian-teen-helps-stop-alleged-utah-animal-cruelty-case) by pooling information to track down an [animal abuser](https://www.reddit.com/r/guineapigs/comments/qipn3y/thank_you_to_everyone_who_tracked_down_this/).

You can help too by questioning suspicious videos or calling out blatantly staged videos whenever you see them, and maybe also by checking if that cute video has already appeared on [r/AnimalRights](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalRights/), [r/quityourbullshit](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/) or [r/untrustworthypoptarts](https://www.reddit.com/r/untrustworthypoptarts/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

If you want to see animals in peril without them actually being in any kind of peril, [r/reverseanimalrescue](https://www.reddit.com/r/reverseanimalrescue/) is a subreddit dedicated to reversing gifs to make it look like animals / people in them are being put into dangerous situations.

#Annual Events and Celebrations on Reddit  
::Lore and History::  

Reddit loves traditions, as you might expect. April Fools Day, Halloween, Christmas and the New Year are very well represented here, as are other holidays and festivals such as:

[r/Eid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eid/): A place to gather and prepare and share Muslim holiday traditions, whether for Eid-ul-Fitr or Eid-ul-Qurbani.

[r/diwali](https://www.reddit.com/r/diwali/): A subreddit for all things Diwali, Divali, Deepavali - the Hindu festival of lights.

[r/thanksgiving](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanksgiving/): an American festival known for dinners and drama.

[r/Hanukkah](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hanukkah/): which needs moderators and is currently available for request.

[r/Carnival](https://www.reddit.com/r/Carnival/): a sub for the Celebration known as "Carnival" and often celebrated from February to March.

As always, Wikipedia has [a comprehensive list of holidays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_holidays), and out of interest, here’s an in-depth guide [to faith-based celebrations for 2022](https://www.diversityresources.com/2022-diversity-calendar/).

Reddit also joins in with other annual celebrations. [Black History Month](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/honoring-black-history-month-at-reddit) has been celebrated for [some years now](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/a-look-back-at-black-history-month-at-reddit), as has [Pride Month](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/celebrating-pride-month-with-reddit) and [Women’s History Month](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/womens-history-month-at-reddit-inc).

Reddit also makes its own traditions. An annual event that Reddit started in 2011 is the [Extra Life game day](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtraLife/comments/qnmtn2/reddits_10th_annual_extra_life_game_day/) for fundraising in support of the [Children's Miracle Network Hospitals](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page&id=1251) in the U.S. and Canada. Join in at [r/ExtraLife](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtraLife/).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[r/traditions](https://www.reddit.com/r/traditions/) is a sleepy sub that needs reviving. Any type of tradition is welcome here; TV show with a special treat, pastries and hot chocolate Saturday mornings, yearly camping trips, when your grandparents visit, fishing at a specific location, etc.

#Anonymity  
::General Guides::  

Reddit is not like other social networking platforms. Users on Reddit [are anonymous](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/86e3o4/is_reddit_anonymous/). When you sign up, you’re asked to compose the username you want to use. You’ll need to provide an email address when registering, but this is not tied in any way to your username or password so it can’t be traced back unlike other sites like Facebook and Twitter where they are connected. Nobody can see the email address or any 2FA information attached to your account. It’s even possible to have a completely random username assigned to you by creating your account using "sign in with Google/Apple”. This can sometimes happen by accident (See [Accidental Alt](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/2/#wiki_accidental_alt)) if you have an existing Reddit account.

Awards on Reddit can be doubly anonymous. If you give a Reddit award, nobody else participating on the post or comment you awarded will know who the award came from, and if you select “Award this anonymously” when giving it, the recipient won’t know it was from you either. The recipient will still be able to thank you, however, and should you reply to that message, your username will then be revealed to that person.

Nobody will ever see what posts or comments you have upvoted, downvoted, saved or hidden, nor will they see the Subreddits you have Joined or Left. You will never be asked for personal information or to divulge your friend circle. Your age, gender, race, location, political, ideological or religious affiliations are nobody’s business except yours, and are even of little interest outside of the specific subreddits for those discussions. You are here for your own sake, and that’s enough for everyone else.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[r/privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/) looks at the intersection of technology, privacy, and freedom in a digital world.

#April Fools Day  
::Lore and History::  

April Fools Day is a tradition very much embraced at Reddit, as you might expect, and its home is at [r/aprilfools](https://www.reddit.com/r/aprilfools/). Many Subreddits [change their theme or subject matter](https://www.reddit.com/r/aprilfools/comments/mholsm/megathread_subreddit_prank_log_for_april_1st_2021/) for the day, and more info on historical pranks throughout Reddit can be [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/search/?q=April%20fool&restrict_sr=1&sr_nsfw=&sort=relevance) and also [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/search/?q=April%20fool&restrict_sr=1&sr_nsfw=&sort=new).

Some past sitewide events have gone down in Reddit history and are still talked about now, (especially 2015’s ‘The Button’ and 2017’s ‘Place’) and a short précis of many of them [can be found here](https://medium.com/@arbistarkillerllaveshi/reddit-april-fools-the-social-sandbox-28960a739bc4). Since first writing this entry, Reddit themselves have made a [video history of the April Fools events](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/tno8rk/its_no_foolin_the_history_of_april_fools_on_reddit/).

#Astroturfing  
::Culture and Etiquette::  

Astroturfing is the practice of spreading misinformation by masking the sponsors of a message or organisation to make it appear as though it originates from, and is supported by, the true participants of the infiltrated community. It’s named for a brand of fake grass called “Astroturf“ because the perpetrator is trying to fake “grassroots” support for their product (“grassroots” being when people come together organically for a common cause) while stifling the real grassroots support.

Originally a public relations term, [Online Reputation Management (ORM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_management) deals with the influencing, controlling, enhancing, or concealing of an individual's or group's reputation. It is a practice intended to give a statement or organisation credibility and one of their primary tactics is to withhold information about the source's financial connection.

Multiple online identities and fake pressure groups are used to mislead the public into believing that the position of the astroturfer is the commonly held view. It’s a lucrative business, with adverts proclaiming “We can Fix, Build and Protect your Online Reputation to establish Credibility and Trust”, “We delete news stories, blogs, legal links and more…”. Or, as the advertising blurb of one provider says: “Online Reputation Management works to counter, weaken or eliminate negative material online and generate and promote the positive.”

[Reddit itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soYkEqDp760) has been the target of astroturfing [more than once](https://www.reddit.com/r/lastweektonight/comments/g507nq/reddit_user_uncovers_massive_astroturfing/), and an interesting discussion [went on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/rpm78d/copaganda_in_the_wholesome_subreddits/) with several Redditors speculating that it’s still happening.

Misinformation isn’t just spread by ORM providers as we have learned in the last couple of years, and indeed in late 2021, [Redditors felt the need to rise up](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/01/reddit-communities-go-dark-in-protest-over-covid-misinformation) and challenge Reddit about misinformation being spread [by some subs Brigading others](https://www.theverge.com/22652705/reddit-covid-misinformation-ban-nonewnormal-health-policies).

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[r/MassMove](https://www.reddit.com/r/MassMove/) aims to be an antivirus to the misinformation campaigns waged against us by being [a social engineering movement propagated by people and memes via distributed civil disobedience](https://www.reddit.com/r/MassMove/wiki/index).

#Automod  
::Features of Reddit::  

Automod, or [u/automoderator](https://www.reddit.com/u/automoderator/) is a [tool that moderators use](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/automoderator) to perform tasks on their behalf. AutoModerator is a highly customisable moderation bot, monitoring new and edited submissions and comments and acting on them as needed. One ability that Automod has is to remove any posts or comments that use specific words or phrases, or even from a specific user, without a human being involved in that process at all. Automod can even be set up to recognise key words which can prompt it to comment with some relevant information.

Originally an [independent bot](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/10/30/75229/reddits-automoderator-automod-catches-more-than-any-human-could-but-its-still-imperfect/), Automod now is an integral part of Reddit’s native tools that [help moderators run certain processes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/comments/q11pu/what_is_automoderator/) in their subs.

Do not reply to a comment made by Automod in a post as it doesn’t read them. Unless it’s our Automod in [r/NewToReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/) who likes being told “Good job Automod” or “Thanks Automod”…. [r/AutoModerator](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/).

#Avatar 
::Features of Reddit::  

Everyone on Reddit has an avatar - a little picture representing our Reddit presence. The default one is a small coloured circle with a ghostly Snoo (Reddit’s little alien mascot) inside. There are [several ways](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043036152-How-do-I-update-my-avatar-image-) to customise your profile with an avatar either of your own or [a personalised Reddit Snoo](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043035352-How-do-I-customize-and-style-my-avatar-).

An attempt to publicise the new “Snoovatars” by giving them occasional red sparkles [wasn’t well received](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/ozu8t3/did_i_win_something_or_is_reddit_just_trying_to/) but an even more peculiar thing happened shortly after - instead of facing left as they had done since inception, users started to report that [their snoos were suddenly facing right](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/oyaxv1/why_my_avatar_facing_the_other_way/h7t07q1). So far we haven’t been given any official reason behind that change but I believe it’s to make our comment Snoo icon face towards the username and comment. Although, I must say I was hoping it was gearing up for a new version of the old April Fools Day Event “Periwinkle/Orangered” only this time with “Lefties/Righties” but, alas, it wasn’t to be. I think Reddit missed a trick there.

When is an avatar no longer an avatar? When the word falls out of use in favour of PFP - a growing acronym in texting and social media meaning both Picture For Proof and Profile Pic.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

Show off your snoovatar at [r/snoovatars](https://www.reddit.com/r/snoovatars/)! As the word “avatar” has different associations, I would be remiss in not mentioning [r/ATLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATLA/) \- a community specifically for the original animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender, [r/AvatarMemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AvatarMemes/) or [r/TheLastAirbender](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/) for all media in that franchise - [see here for more](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/i4dk9e/are_there_any_other_avatar_subs_i_should_know/). Likewise [r/Avatar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/) for news, art, comments, insights and more on the beautiful and dangerous world of Pandora.

#Awards  
::Features of Reddit::  

Awards are a way for Redditors to reward other users for posts and comments that they enjoyed, felt either elevated the conversation and culture within a given community, or simply because it made them laugh out loud.

An award given will appear as a small icon next to the post or comment title and applies to that post or comment only. Some awards even give the recipient some Reddit coins, periods of Reddit Premium and other benefits. Awards are normally purchased using Reddit Coins but you’ll occasionally get given a free award by Reddit to confer on any post or comment you think is deserving.

At the bottom of each post or comment is an icon resembling a box tied with a bow. Pressing this will bring up the current list of awards with their descriptions and prices. You can get more information and give an award to that post or comment by selecting the one you want. **Be careful when browsing the descriptions - giving the award accidentally is non-refundable.**

The profile page of the lovely Redditor [u/N1GHT-MOON-UN1C0RN](https://www.reddit.com/user/N1GHT-MOON-UN1C0RN/comments/lbn0ds/awards/) shows many of the awards in action. If you’re on mobile, tap one and a little description of them all will appear. I can’t say at present if this is available on desktop.

Awards that give you periods of Reddit Premium are cumulative, in that if you get two golds on one post or in one week (for example), that will give you two consecutive weeks of free premium Reddit.

If you receive 100 awards in one calendar month, you get a “100 Awards Club” trophy for your profile. These can be any award given to you on both posts and comments in the space of one month.

**Because there is a Subreddit for everything:**

[r/awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/awards/) is a sub for chat and information about Reddit awards and the system.

#Award Abuse  
::Culture and Etiquette::  

While most people give awards with the best intentions, the introduction of the free awards led to a phenomenon of them being [deliberately used inappropriately](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/ghn9be/inappropriate_reddit_community_awards_used_). So much so that some subreddits have had to put [measures in place to stop awards being given out](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/gjat2k/hide_inappropriate_awards_from_posts_or_comments/) \- often in the very subreddits where people are needing that extra bit of kindness at that particular time.

Admin agreed that [something needed to be done](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/gr6fsc/following_up_on_awards_abuse/) and rolled a block feature out in mid 2020 [so moderators and redditors alike can now:](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hwn8zy/new_safety_features_for_awards/)

* **Block Awarders:**

All users will be able to block Awarders, even when awards are given anonymously. If a user (Recipient) blocks another user (Awarder) from Awarding them, it means that the Awarder will not be able to give Awards to the Recipient anymore. This feature is intended to prevent spam and harassment of users via Awards and/or Private Messages. This will be available on all platforms (mobile, new Reddit, and old Reddit).

* **Report Award Messages:**

Award recipients will be able to report private messages sent with awards for sitewide policy violations like harassment from their inbox. These reports will come straight to Reddit admins and will be actioned following the same protocol as direct user-to-user private messages. This will be available on all platforms (mobile, new Reddit, and old Reddit).

* **Flag Awards:**

All users will be able to “Flag Awards” to point out inappropriate usage. These reports will come straight to Reddit admins, and evaluated on a case-by-case basis as we continue to iterate on our Award catalog. This will be available on mobile and new Reddit.

And in case you were wondering, [this is why we can’t have nice things](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/ij2amd/people_giving_this_post_awards_like_wholesome_and/).

#award-cost-bot  
::Interesting and Miscellaneous::  

This is a ‘service bot’ built to check the price of awards that have been given on comments and submissions. It can be summoned by typing [u/award-cost-bot](https://www.reddit.com/u/award-cost-bot/) as a reply to the awarded post or comment. Why would we need such a bot? [Because some posts sometimes get all the awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/jq193s/the_cost_and_benefits_of_reddit_awards_on_a/) and it’s nice to see how much other people value you in real terms.

#Award Farming  
::Culture and Etiquette::  

Posts and comments asking about awards are more often than not thinly veiled attempts at begging for them. Don’t fall into this trap from either side. Like karma, you should make sure you don’t talk *about* awards outside this subreddit. The only other place where it is acceptable is on [r/awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/awards/). In almost any other subreddit, the very mention of the word can be interpreted as “award farming” which is very much disliked [and will be ridiculed](https://i.redd.it/dtioktlqnac51.jpg). It can also backfire on you, as an “unwritten rule of gilding” on Reddit is *“If someone is asking for gold, gild the comment above or below them, but under no circumstance gild the comment itself.”*

Award farming can range from asking outright for awards, to acting like you don’t want awards, to acting like you want to stop people that are trying to farm awards, through using an Alt account to “talk” to yourself to try and circumvent the “unwritten rule of gilding”. Reddit loves being meta. Until you’re [banned for vote manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/n89eop/if_i_make_an_alt_just_to_upvote_and_award_a_post/).

#Award Karma / Awardee Karma  
::Features of Reddit::  

There are four kinds of karma: [Post, Comment, Awarder and Awardee](https://i.imgur.com/AffCOsh.jpg). A recent addition to Reddit, you get karma for giving Awards (Awarder Karma) and for being given Awards (Awardee Karma). It’s important to note that this karma does not count towards fulfilling the minimum karma requirements imposed by some subs.

I’ve seen it said that the amount of award karma you get is based on how recent the comment/post is. For instance; a low cost award would give you 9 or 10 karma if you award it to someone within the first hour, but the older the comment/post is, the less karma you get for giving the award. That makes sense when you consider the voting system is designed to keep content on Reddit moving, fresh and relevant as this would counterbalance how people give awards to highly upvoted and already highly awarded posts. I haven’t yet found anything official to back this up yet, so while it rings true it might not necessarily be the case.

#Award Notifications  
::Features of Reddit::  

When you receive an award from a fellow Redditor, you should receive a Notification in your Inbox that says something like this:

*An anonymous redditor liked your comment so much that they've given it the Platinum Award. As a reward, you get a sparkling medal on your comment and a one month trial of* [*Reddit Premium*](https://www.reddit.com/premium) *to improve your experience! Dashing.*

There will be a short list of the benefits (if any) to your award, followed by instructions on how to use your Coins (if you were awarded any):

*You can use your Coins to give Awards to posts and comments that are inspiring, helpful, funny, or whatever. Press the Give Award button beneath the post or comment and follow the prompts, it's that easy!*

Finally, there will be an opportunity to reply to whoever awarded you:

*Want to say thanks to your mysterious benefactor? Reply to this message. You will find out their username if they choose to reply back.*

However, in early 2021, Reddit started to direct award notifications to Direct Chat [which came with its own set of problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/ng2txt/help_note_with_an_award_is_showing_up_in_chat/) and by mid 2021 it was the case that awards could sometimes be given or received with no notification whatsoever, leaving no opportunity for thanks or other acknowledgement. This is [an ongoing issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/r0m9jx/getting_award_notifications_via_chat_is_confusing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and very frustrating for me as in November as part of a celebration I gave out over 30 gold awards with many of their recipients having no idea where they came from - or even ever having had them. For some people that was a week of free premium lost in the ether. I’ll think more than twice before doing that again.

With few exceptions (the free awards), if you get a Reddit award, the awarder will have spent hard-earned or even purchased Reddit coins to give it. You will, no doubt want to thank them, but this shouldn’t be done by editing your awarded post, because the awarder won’t see that acknowledgement.

When I receive an award from a fellow Redditor and receive a notification, I always say thank you for whatever award it is. Reddit has a thing about “saying thanks is lame” at times. Saying thanks is NOT “lame”, and should be done more IMHO. Awards can be given anonymously, and most are. Even so, you can still thank them by responding to the Award Notification. “Thanks for the Gold, kind stranger!” or “Thanks for the award, Kind Redditor” are the traditional responses. Reddit loves traditions.

#AwardSpeechEdits  
::Culture and Etiquette::  

A link posted when an unnecessary "award speech" is made on Reddit (or other social media sites) by editing their posts after they've become popular or gilded. Award speeches are mocked unmercifully on [r/AwardSpeechEdits](https://www.reddit.com/r/AwardSpeechEdits/), so if your post gets a torrent of upvotes or is even Gilded, DO NOT edit your post. The person who gave you the Award will probably not see the edit and nobody else cares. You should instead send a thanks message directly to the gilder through the Award Notification. This also allows the awarder to remain anonymous while still being thanked for their kindness.

However, there is a trend on Reddit to ironically edit a post multiple times to thank people for gold and tell them that it's their highest rated comment. The format usually goes something like this:

* Edit: THANKS FOR THE GOLD KIND STRANGER.
* Edit 2: CAN'T BELIEVE MY TOP COMMENT IS ABOUT X (where ‘X’ is whatever the post was about).
* Edit 3: RIP my inbox.
* Edit 4: Guys please stop. Don’t give money to Reddit, give it to charity.
* Holy crap guys... Since I'm getting all this publicity, check out my [mixtape](https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0).

The “mixtape” link might also be a Rickroll. It might not be. It usually is. Except when it isn’t. Judge for yourself whether that’s a risky click or not. [r/AwardSpeechEdits](https://www.reddit.com/r/AwardSpeechEdits/).

#Award Types  
::Features of Reddit::  

Awards are tokens of appreciation given by Redditors to other Redditors in recognition of merit for their contributions, whether they be heartwarming, helpful, hilarious or otherwise distinctive.

There are many types of Reddit Awards, ranging from ones that look pretty on your post or comment but do nothing else, through to ones that give you Reddit goodies. With the exception of the occasional Free Awards Reddit gives out, they all require coins to give, and in 2020, a user at [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) calculated the actual [monetary cost of the awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/hll1xk/oc_price_of_reddit_awards/) available at the time.

* **Specials**

There are some awards which stand out from the rest. Some can give you Reddit Coins, periods of advert-free Reddit Premium and/or even a trophy for your Reddit Profile. Some are animated, and some Highlighting awards make a comment really stand out from other replies. Another set of “chain” awards [give you accumulated benefits](https://www.reddit.com/r/awards/comments/l284xd/this_and_party_train_awards_can_evolve_max/), such as “Party Train”, where for every five awarded on one post or comment, the better the benefit and the icon. These enable several people to pool together to [eventually show this](https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Train/Train_argentium_128.png). The “This” award works in a similar way where every three awarded on one post or comment [will show this](https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/This_argentium_512.png). More on four of these types of awards below.

* **Limited Editions**

Seasonal award variations are added and retired from time to time. In 2020, a special “Wearing is Caring” award was introduced, featuring a Snoo wearing a surgical mask. This award earns both the giver and the recipient a trophy for their profile. Some subreddits have Mod Awards or other special awards exclusively for that sub, and some awards give Coins to both the recipient and the community - a pool that mods can use in their sub to give out Community Awards. Some awards require you to have Reddit Premium to give (but not receive) them, such as the “All-Seeing-Upvote” or “Narwhal Salute”. There are currently eight of these exclusives. A free Highlighting Award “Powerups Comment” is occasionally available to Community Heroes to give in the subreddit they are powering-up.

The four types of awards I describe below are ones that give gifts as well as the award (coins, premium or a highlight) and the availability, costs and types were correct at time of writing. I may or may not update accordingly as these change quite frequently. The best place to find out about all the types of award and to keep up to date with any changes is [r/awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/awards/).

* **Gift Award Type 1: Gifts Both Coins and Reddit Premium**

The main awards that give both Reddit Coins and Reddit Premium are:

* *Party Train:* Costs 75 coins to give. Every 5 awarded to the same post or comment gives the recipient 100 coins and a week of free Reddit Premium. The 5 awards do not have to come from the same person. It’s interesting to note here that if the same person gives 5 Party Trains to one post or comment, it will give the same benefits to the recipient as Gold but only costing 375 Coins - a saving of 125 Coins. However, the giver will not get points towards a Gilding Level Trophy.
* *Gold:* Costs 500 Coins to give. This gives the recipient an immediate 100 Coins and a week of free Reddit Premium. The giver gets one point towards a Gilding Level Trophy.
* *Platinum:* Costs 1800 Coins to give. This gives the recipient 700 Coins for the month and one month of free Reddit Premium. The giver gets four points towards a Gilding Level Trophy. See the note on the Platinum Award below.
* *Argentium:* Costs 20,000 Coins to give. This gives the recipient an immediate 2,500 Coins and three months of free Reddit Premium. Both giver and recipient get a trophy for their Reddit profiles.
* *Ternion All Powerful:* Costs 50,000 Coins to give. This gives the recipient an immediate 5,000 Coins and six months of free Reddit Premium. Both giver and recipient get a trophy for their Reddit profiles.

There are rumours of admin-only awards greater than this which cannot be purchased. You might even encounter one so rare it’s *almost unobtainable*. [Click the icons, scroll down, and treasure the moment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/g15hel/every_day_general_grievous_adds_a_unique/)

The periods of Reddit Premium you get from these awards is cumulative! If your post and comment blows up and you get (for example) four golds and one platinum, you will have eight subsequent weeks of Reddit Premium. The coins for platinum might not appear immediately; the complicated reason for this is addressed below.

* **Gift Award Type 2: Highlighting Awards**

These don’t give any gifts but do make your comment look very distinctive.

* *Brighten My Day:* Costs 500 coins to give. “The clouds part and the sun shines through. Use the Brighten My Day Award to highlight comments that are a ray of sunshine.”
* *Eureka!:* Costs 500 coins to give. “Now that is a bright idea. Use the Eureka Award to highlight comments that are brilliant.”
* *Starry:* Costs 500 coins to give. “Use the Starry Award to highlight comments that deserve to stand out from the crowd.”

A free Highlighting Award *Powerups Comment* is occasionally available to Powerup Community Heroes to give in powered-up subs.

* **Gift Award Type 3: Community Awards**

Community Awards give coins to both the recipient and the community.

* *Awesome Answer:* Costs 250 coins to give. This gives 100 coins to both the recipient and the community.
* *Mind Blown:* Costs 250 coins to give. This gives 100 coins to both the recipient and the community.
* *Original:* Costs 250 coins to give. This gives 100 coins to both the recipient and the community.
* *Timeless Beauty:* Costs 250 coins to give. This gives 100 coins to both the recipient and the community.
* *Today I Learned:* Costs 250 coins to give. This gives 100 coins to both the recipient and the community.
* *Bless Up (Pro):* Costs 500 coins to give. This gives 100 coins to both the recipient and the community.
* *Heart Eyes:* Costs 500 coins to give. This gives 100 coins to both the recipient and the community.
* *Helpful (Pro):* Costs 500 coins to give. This gives 100 coins to both the recipient and the community.
* *Made Me Smile:* Costs 500 coins to give. This gives 100 coins to both the recipient and the community.
* *Wholesome (Pro):* Costs 500 coins to give. This gives 100 coins to both the recipient and the community.

There may be other Community Awards unique to the subreddit you are in. To see these, at the bottom of each post or comment is an icon resembling a box tied with a bow. Pressing this will bring up the current list of awards with their descriptions and prices. Be very careful when browsing the awards like this - giving the award accidentally is non-refundable.

* **Gift Award Type 4: Coin Awards**

Coin Awards give coins and no other benefits to the recipient only.

* *2020 Veteran:* Costs 200 coins to give. This gives 100 coins to the recipient.
* *Coin Gift:* Costs 300 coins to give. This gives 250 coins to the recipient.
* *Pot O' Coins:* Costs 1000 coins to give. This gives 800 coins to the recipient.
* *This:* Costs 300 coins to give. Every 3 awarded to the same post or comment gives the recipient 250 coins. The 3 awards do not have to come from the same person.

Some figures are based partly on an original post by [u/memedbyshrek](https://www.reddit.com/u/memedbyshrek/) at [r/AwardBonanza](https://www.reddit.com/r/AwardBonanza/). Another comprehensive list of award types is [shown here](https://github.com/androiddevnotes/reddit-awards/).

* **A Note on the Platinum Award**

Platinum is not like any other Reddit premium award in that you might not get the coins immediately, depending on other factors such as any awards you might have previously won. The explanation and details can be found at “[Platinum Awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncyclopaediaOfReddit/wiki/5/#wiki_platinum_awards)”.
